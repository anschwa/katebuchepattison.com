  <h1>La Mitad-Half Full or Half Empty?</h1>
  <time datetime="2015-10-19">October 19, 2015</time>

  <p>
    My first morning back was less hard to face than I had feared
    (Mondays are always a rude jolt back into reality, especially
    after the beach…) we started level 5 with our new teacher María (<em>not</em> Maria,
    the tilde is very important, as we learned all week) It promises
    to be a good class, with more focus on culture and literature, and
    lesson on grammar, which should be more exciting.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I got home from my art class at 8, empanada preparation was
    in full swing (and had been since 5, apparently) and I was
    immediately pressed into service rolling out the dough (made of
    nothing but a bit of oil, water, and green plantains) that Gustavo
    was kneading, as Ximena kept adding more and more blended
    plantains to the already impressive amount of dough in the bowl.
    This went on for hours, with minor improvements in technique and
    efficiency along the way. Suffice it to say it was an astounding
    amount of empanadas, and by the time they were all made (we
    counted around 50) and either fried, or put away to be frozen for
    later, we finally finished eating some around 11!

    Tuesday after class, Sarah and Tyler and I finished
    "Contracorriente" ("Undertow") which was a movie we had watched in
    Gender class the week before we left for Bahía, but hadn't
    finished-I highly recommend it, quite an interesting Peruvian
    film. Since it took longer than expected to find it on YouTube, I
    arrived to that very gender class quite wet (it started pouring as
    the credits were rolling) and a bit late…but class was about half
    its normal size, since the Ecuador-Bolivia soccer game was the
    exact hours of class, so we had class in the cafeteria, so we
    could get coffee to warm up from the rain, and listened to the
    cheers that echoed out, in order to determine when a goal was
    scored. We won 2-0, by the way.

    After class on Thursday, I had a debriefing meeting with Rodolfo
    about Bahía, then set off for el Museo de la Ciudad to see the
    photography exposition "La Huella Invertida" ("The inverted
    footprint/track") with historic photos of Quito by José Domingo
    Laso, an early 20th century photographer. We had to write 2000
    words analyzing the uses, techniques and audience, as well as the
    historical significance, and then choose a photo to replicate, and
    interpret the differences and similarities between the modern and
    historic photos. Ximena had told me the right bus to catch to get
    over there, to the historic district, so I arrived with only a
    liiiiitttllle wondering around the steep and slippery cobbled
    streets as it poured rain, being confused and asking for
    directions over and over… I found it eventually, feeling guilty as
    I dripped my way through the exposition
  </p>

    I was so proud of myself for finding my way back down to the bus
    station, figuring out which slot to put my quarter in, and being
    at the correct bus stop to return to school for class at 4-I was
    even going to be on time! Look how grown up I am from the 15 year
    old Kate who got so hopelessly lost on a bus in Germany…
  </p>

  <p>
    So I got on the bus, and everything was perfect…until it turned
    and I didn't know where we were going anymore. The bus then began
    to fill to sardine level (the question from orientation sprang to
    mind again: "how many people can fit on an Ecuadorian bus? the
    answer is always 15 more" ) such that if I had come to some stop I
    knew how to navigate back to school from, I seriously doubt I
    would have been able to un-peel myself from the window I was
    plastered to, and wiggle my way out anyway. So when I arrived at
    the end of the line, and everyone finally got off, I gave up on
    buses, and surrendered my 4 dollars to the very friendly (but not
    creepy) taxista who brought me all the way back across the city to
    school…only an hour late for class…

    I came home to a lovely dinner of bread and colada morada,
    traditionally served for day of the dead. It is a thick, warm
    drink with herbs and pieces of fruit—deliciosa. Ximena had made
    enough for allll her friends:

    <figcaption>
      See that absurdly large pot that you could bathe multiple
      children in, that is balanced precariously on the sink? It was
      alll full of colada morada.

    After Rodolfo's class on Friday, in which we discussed the
    controversial figure of Bartomomé de Las Casas, I went with an art
    compañero to see a mural (that turned out to be decidedly
    underwhelming) on some government building. We had a very
    interesting discussion about politics (his idea is to wipe out the
    population of the USA and start over…I <em>think</em> he was kidding.) on the way over there.
  </p>

  <p>
    Veronica (the anthropology student who is studying us, but now is
    a good friend) came with Sarah back to my house to hangout, and
    after dinner of more colada morada we chatted and never actually
    decided on a movie to watch. The first to drift off was Sarah, as
    Veronica told Tyler and I about her relationship history (its
    amazing how much speaking a foreign language all week wears you
    out) then Tyler slowly got quiet as Veronica and I continued
    chatting about her summer travels, and the political-economic
    relations and history of the Andean region and Gran-Colombia. At
    around 11 Veronica's mom took the sleepy heads home to bed.

    Saturday morning we (Ximena, Gustavo and I) left for Guyabamba to
    celebrate the baptism of Gustavo's cousin's daughter. We were a
    liiiitle late, so missed the actual Mass, but arrived to the
    beautiful rented park/garden/house place, where a lovely tent was
    set up on the lawn, with decorated chairs, tables and a temporary
    dance floor. We immediately begun the task of kissing pretty much
    everyone there. It really was a lovely place, a sunny day warmer
    than the one we had left in Quito, and the only reason you could
    tell we weren't at a summer wedding reception in the united
    states, was the tostado and chochos that were the appetizer at
    every table. I soon discarded my flats and enjoyed the feeling of
    the spongy grass-covered ground under my feet, and between my
    toes-a feeling I hadn't realized I had missed until then. When we
    got in line for lunch, and I said no to the roasted pork, I was
    also introduced to the mother (Gustavo's cousin) who immediately
    named me "prima veggie" (veggie cousin) and it stuck for the rest
    of the day. As soon as we were done eating, we started the
    dancing: meringue, salsa, traditional indigenous dances, the
    twist… little bit of everything. We only stopped to take a tour of
    the grounds, and to take some pictures (most of which Ximena later
    deleted, claiming she just isn't photogenic…)

    We slipped out just as the baby's father's family broke out the
    whiskey and tried to give us all some. After another round of even
    more kisses this time (it never seems to bother anyone that to
    most of them I am a random stranger at their family gathering,
    they just kiss me anyway) we got in the car, exhausted, and headed
    back. After a surprisingly brief pit stop to visit some Cuban
    friends of Ximena's, and later to drink morocho (a thick corn
    drink) and eat empanadas, we arrived back home. I was actually in
    bed asleep by 9 pm-sometimes that's the finest luxury on a
    weekend.
  </p>

  <p>
    I rose early on Sunday for a rainy day of cleaning my
    room/bathroom, homework (all that writing about art) and trying to
    ward off the Sunday blues. Just as I was lagging in my efforts in
    that area, Ximena brought me popcorn, which brought a big smile
    with it, as I had just been nostalgically longing for those rainy
    fall Sunday of soup and popcorn with my family…
  </p>

  <p>
    When I first arrived, I was told that Quito's climate is like a
    woman's mood-it can change violently at any moment, and without
    much warning (Rodolfo was appalled at the sexism in inherent in
    the comparison, and though I agree, its interesting how I might be
    proving it true). My mood seems to be very changeable indeed here:
    one moment feeling forlorn or lonely, the next utterly contented.
    I go from wanting the two months I have left here to speed quickly
    by so I can get home to the familiar world I miss so much
    (although I know that the way I see it will be inevitably changed
    by how<em> I</em> have changed) and then in the next moment, it
    shifts the other way. As I am laughing about the absurd quantity
    of empanadas we are making, or feeling inspired by the fabulous
    article about gender I just read-the richness and wonder that
    comes from being able to relate my three classes about art, gender
    and travel narratives all together, or laughing at myself because
    some things never seem to change, and public transportation still
    trips me up, apparently…and I can't help but think there is still
    so much to be soaked up from this country, like the last drops of
    sugary juice, straight from the cane. There are so many words to
    be learned, places to see, discussions to have, foods to try and
    people to meet-how could two months be enough for it all?
