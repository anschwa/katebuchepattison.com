    The packing and cleaning took much longer than expected, of
    course. But we did indeed make it out of the house before the
    guests arrived. We also made it to the ferry dock early enough to
    withdraw some Danish Crowns from the ATM and eat some leftover
    potato salad that we had to take with us, before the bus took us
    to the ferry to board. It was all very exciting, having never been
    on an international ferry before, and <em>extremely</em> windy! We
    really experienced this to the full extent, because a short
    excursion below-decks to get Adam some coffee quickly revealed
    that fresh air would be the only way to keep me from seasickness.
    So we stayed on the top deck the rest of the ride&mdash;watching the
    seagulls race the boat and getting buffeted around ourselves.
    There are oh so many pictures available here:

  <p>
    We had a long way still to go by the time we got to Gedser, the
    Danish port town where the Ferry landed. We were supposed to get
    on a bus, but after a confusing German interaction with the Danish
    driver we ended up missing what actually <em>WAS</em> the right
    bus, and having to walk into town, as it got darker and rainier.
    We stumbled upon a cute little cafe however, where we were first
    told we didn't have to wear our masks, and had enough time to warm
    up and split an award-winning alcohol-free Danish beer before
    getting on the next bus.
  </p>

  <p>
    We eventually transferred to a train which delivered us at last to
    Copenhagen Central Station where we a bit taken aback to see that
    yes, really no one, even in the capital, were wearing masks. It
    was a bit surreal, but apparently the Danes have reached a 75%
    vaccination rate, so they decided it was safe. Being vaccinated
    ourselves we decided to trust the health authorities, because
    doing so had so far led Denmark confidently through the pandemic.
    It was rather late by the time we made it to our airbnb, where our
    host welcomed us with tea and chocolate, which is just what we
    needed after a long afternoon of traveling.
  </p>

  <p>
    We woke up refreshed on Saturday morning, and headed to an
    adorable and (after we did the currency conversion math) it turned
    out very affordable little cafe down the street for some
    breakfast. The desire to get a Danish pastry in Denmark was
    strong, but I ended up being glad I had opted for the hardier egg
    because of all the walking we did that day.
  </p>

  <p>
    After a quick hello to Hans (Christian Anderson) we headed off to
    the Danish National Museum. Or at least that's where we thought we
    were going, but int turned out that we happened upon the
    Copenhagen Museum first, so that is where we spent a few
    informative hours instead. In addition to some in-depth history of
    the city, from its prehistoric days right up until the present, we
    also got to see some really interesting architectural drawings
    from the city planner's office. They had blueprints of everything
    from lamp posts to sewage treatment plants; from schools to
    streetcars. It was very interesting, and a good first stop, since
    I think it made us see the city through clearer eyes, knowing some
    of the history and design that went into it.

  <p>
    We were a bit museum-ed out by the time we left, so we just
    strolled around for a while until we decided we were hungry, and
    stopped into a cafe with a very friendly waiter who was happy to
    chat with us about how much he loved Chicago. We ordered what
    turned out to be extremely tiny but very elegant open-face
    sandwiches (mine had boiled <em>and</em> fried potatoes on it!)
    and beers that were in fact about as big as our heads.
  </p>

    </a>

    <figcaption>Potatoes, beer and bread: what's not to like?</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Though adorable and delicious, the sandwiches were not in fact a
    very substantial lunch, so we ended up at 7-eleven in search of
    some quick snacks before our walking tour began. I ended up
    getting seduced by the Danishes there, so ironically my first
    experience of Danish pastry in Denmark was at an American
    convenience store! When we showed up a minute late for the tour,
    the guide immediately told me that this didn't really count and I
    had to go to a <em>real</em> bakery before leaving the city. I
    knew he was right, of course, but I must say the cinnamon roll
    wasn't half bad&mdash;much better than I would have expected of a
    7-eleven in the US.

    </a>

    <figcaption>
      My expectations were low, but definitely surpassed! It was
      unlike anything the 7-eleven in the US would have had.

  <p>
    The tour was an interesting mix of nationalities, from the
    originally Australian guide to the Danish girl he kept asking how
    to pronounce things properly. We were told some interesting facts:
    like how the coiled animals whose tails slither up the spire on
    the Christianborg palace are <em>supposed</em> to be crocodiles,
    except the poor architect had never actually seen a crocodile, or
    even a picture of one, it appears… We also saw several buildings
    on the island of Christianshavn that are actively settling and
    leaning and zigging and zagging due to the originally swampy
    nature of the land. The tour ended outside the gates of <q>The Free
    Town of Christiania</q> which is indeed marching to the beat of
    its own drum. Quite literally, as it turned out, as there was an
    active drum circle going on when we wandered in. The area is known
    for its flourishing trade in…not quite legal substances, but
    also for its mostly peaceful coexistence with the surrounding
    city. It was certainly an interesting detour!

      Our tour guide said they looked more like Disney's cartoon dog

  <p>
    We decided to get a grocery store dinner and eat it as a picnic,
    before making the obligatory trip to see the <i>Little Mermaid
    statue</i>. We ate at what we discovered was actually an active
    Danish military base, which might not sound very picturesque, but
    in the case of Kastellet, it actually was. It was built in the
    17th century, and you can stroll along the star-shaped ramparts,
    and look over the harbor, which we did. We did indeed see the
    remarkably small (and in fact famously unremarkable) Little
    Mermaid statue as the sun sank low in the sky.
  </p>

  <p>
    After dark, we headed back to the airbnb and dropped off our day
    packs and went in search of an evening adventure. We ended up in a
    touristy area near the Tivoli, where we waited in a very long line
    for expensive but rather yummy cocktails and some strange
    <q>nachos</q>. The quotes are because we have discovered that Europe
    doesn't really understand nachos. In the same way that they would
    probably argue that America doesn't understand pizza. They were
    Doritos with melted cheddar, some dubious guac, sour cream and
    their best attempt at salsa (basically ketchup with some onions,
    peppers and diced canned tomatoes.) None of it was gross, exactly
    just not really what we were expecting when we ordered nachos.
    Anyway, we got to sit outside on a lovely night in Copenhagen, so
    the main goal was achieved.
  </p>

  <p>
    The next morning started off with another trip to Sonja's Cafe
    down the street, where I tried the chia seed porridge this
    time&mdash;complete with some excellent strawberry jam. We then
    set off for Rosenborg Castle. It was a country summer house built
    in 1606 by the Danish king at the time, Christian IV, but was
    expanded over the years, until it reached its current size in
    1624.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was a very well set-up museum, with tons of displays of royal
    trinkets, including hand-carved ivory sculptures that incorporated
    Ostrich eggs, conch shell goblets, detailed botanical paintings
    and of course tons and tons of lavish jewelry and impressive
    paintings. What fascinated me most of all though, in the four
    levels of splendor were in fact not the crown jewels on display in
    the basement, but the walls, floors and ceilings themselves. Most
    floors were elaborately tiled, though one room had a floor, walls
    and ceiling all of mirrors, which the wide-skirted ladies of the
    time understandably found rather scandalous. Paintings and
    carvings of angels, lions and all manner of mythical beasts peered
    down from most of the ceilings. Even the bathroom was completely
    covered in lovely blue patterned tile! Some rooms had elaborate
    wood paneling, others swirling marble inlays. Most rooms had
    floor-to-ceiling tapestries however, woven in such astoundingly
    intricate detail that we found ourselves intrigued mostly by the
    process of making those. How long must it have taken? How many
    people worked on one tapestry at once? Were the makers of these
    royal wall-hangings esteemed artisans? The fiber artist in me was
    blown away at the detail. In one room there was cold-encrusted
    leather wallpaper! I guess you can get a lot of fancy stuff when
    you're the absolute monarch!

      First of all, no one has ever heard of leather wallpaper, and

  <p>
    After oohing and ahhing at the crown jewels (let me tell you the
    heads that wore those crowns <em>would</em> have been heavy!) we
    rounded off our tour of the castle in the geometrically hedged
    rose garden. Adam patiently waited as I compared the precise
    scents of the yellow, orange, red, pink and white roses. Orange
    was the most intriguing if I remember correctly: sweet, with a
    hint of spice to keep it interesting and not cloying.

  <p>
    After finally stopping at a <em>real</em> bakery to pick up some
    authentic danish pastries (locally known as <q>Wienerbrod</q> or
    <q>Vienna bread</q> after the Austrian bakers that originally brought
    the confections to Denmark, as we had learned on the tour the day
    before) we took our snack to the botanical garden. What a lovely
    place for a snack! The cardamom-cinnamon-poppyseed and the sweet
    dough were spiraled into pure deliciousness: 7-11 had nothing on
    this pastry. We strolled around the gardens and ponds enjoying the
    first changes in the leaves and the last flowers of the summer.

  <p>
    Next up we went to an art gallery that was formerly St. Nicholas
    Church. The lovely tall ceilings and large windows provided a
    wonderful backdrop to the exhibition called <q>Eden</q> by
    Nicoline Liv Andersen that we saw on the first floor. Her
    background in high fashion led to some really intriguing costumes
    featuring plastic drink straws, and her fiber art dealt with
    fertility, femininity and nature in insightful ways as well. On
    the second floor we saw some photos by David Lynch, one exhibit of
    abandoned industrial buildings, one of naked ladies, and one of
    snowmen&mdash;so lots of variety!

    </a>

    <figcaption>See no evil plastic straws</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    After we left the gallery, we remembered that there had been a
    good tip on the walking tour the day before: there was no
    admission charge to go up to the lookout tower of Christianborg
    Castle (same building with the <q>crocodiles</q> on it) so we took the
    elevator up to the top of Copenhagan's tallest tower, at 106
    meters. Christianborg was originally the home of the royal family,
    but after one of the many fires that ravaged the city, the family
    decided to give it to the government and it is now the home of the
    Danish parliament, supreme court and ministry of state. The Queen
    does still use it for some official state visits though,
    apparently.

      />
    </a>

  <p>
    After all the art, gardens, tours and castles, it was time for
    some food. My pizza&mdash;eaten on a cute little balcony, was really in
    keeping with my personal philosophy to order the weirdest thing on
    the menu: it had kale, pistachios, zucchini, squash and olives. It
    was pretty good! Adam's order was more traditional: just a bunch
    of meat.
  </p>

  <p>
    After dinner, we scurried over to the round tower (apparently we
    hadn't had enough towers yet) and raced up its unique spiraled
    ramp in the fading light. Built in 1642 by our pal from Rosenborg,
    King Christian IV it was originally used as an astronomical
    observatory. The hollow central core of the tower is where a choir
    boy who was playing hide-and-seek in 1880 fell down all the way
    through the middle of the tour! Miraculously, he survived though,
    and needless to say, there is a clear plastic panel covering the
    hole now, so no one else can make the same plummeting journey. We
    arrived just in time to see a few of the brightest stars peeking
    out, despite having to compete with the bright lights of the
    surrounding city. It was interesting to get a nighttime tower view
    to contrast with out Christianbor tower views from earlier. We
    also stopped to briefly peruse another art exhibit in on of the
    rooms on our spiral path down, about the many transitions in
    women's lives.

    <figcaption>It was the perfect crouching spot, what else could I do?</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Not up for another busy night, we headed back to the airbnb. We
    heard a lot of booming and eventually learned that we had missed
    out on the fireworks show that marked the closing night at the
    Tivoli&mdash;too bad! It had been a long and pleasantly full day
    nonetheless.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sonja's cafe was closed on our last morning in Copenhagen, so we
    opted for some last pastries and some quick souvenir stops before
    it was time to get on board the bus that would itself later board
    the ferry and take us back to what we were now considering home:
    Rostock.

      We found this fine lady in a tourist shop, and Adam joked <q>Look,

      indeed the appropriate word to describe the real Mermaid statue.
