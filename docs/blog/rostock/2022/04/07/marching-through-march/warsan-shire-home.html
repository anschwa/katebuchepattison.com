          no one leaves home unless<br />
          home is the mouth of a shark<br />
          you only run for the border<br />
          when you see the whole city running as well
        </p>

        <p>
          your neighbors running faster than you<br />
          breath bloody in their throats<br />
          the boy you went to school with<br />
          who kissed you dizzy behind the old tin factory<br />
          is holding a gun bigger than his body<br />
          you only leave home<br />
          when home won’t let you stay.
        </p>

        <p>
          no one leaves home unless home chases you<br />
          fire under feet<br />
          hot blood in your belly<br />
          it’s not something you ever thought of doing<br />
          until the blade burnt threats into<br />
          your neck<br />
          and even then you carried the anthem under<br />
          your breath<br />
          only tearing up your passport in an airport toilet<br />
          sobbing as each mouthful of paper<br />
          made it clear that you wouldn’t be going back.
        </p>

        <p>
          you have to understand,<br />
          that no one puts their children in a boat<br />
          unless the water is safer than the land<br />
          no one burns their palms<br />
          under trains<br />
          beneath carriages<br />
          no one spends days and nights in the stomach of a truck<br />
          feeding on newspaper unless the miles travelled<br />
          means something more than journey.<br />
          no one crawls under fences<br />
          no one wants to be beaten<br />
          pitied
        </p>

        <p>
          no one chooses refugee camps<br />
          or strip searches where your<br />
          body is left aching<br />
          or prison,<br />
          because prison is safer<br />
          than a city of fire<br />
          and one prison guard<br />
          in the night<br />
          is better than a truckload<br />
          of men who look like your father<br />
          no one could take it<br />
          no one could stomach it<br />
          no one skin would be tough enough
        </p>

        <p>
          the<br />
          go home blacks<br />
          refugees<br />
          dirty immigrants<br />
          asylum seekers<br />
          sucking our country dry<br />
          niggers with their hands out<br />
          they smell strange<br />
          savage<br />
          messed up their country and now they want<br />
          to mess ours up<br />
          how do the words<br />
          the dirty looks<br />
          roll off your backs<br />
          maybe because the blow is softer<br />
          than a limb torn off
        </p>

        <p>
          or the words are more tender<br />
          than fourteen men between<br />
          your legs<br />
          or the insults are easier<br />
          to swallow<br />
          than rubble<br />
          than bone<br />
          than your child body<br />
          in pieces.<br />
          i want to go home,<br />
          but home is the mouth of a shark<br />
          home is the barrel of the gun<br />
          and no one would leave home<br />
          unless home chased you to the shore<br />
          unless home told you<br />
          to quicken your legs<br />
          leave your clothes behind<br />
          crawl through the desert<br />
          wade through the oceans<br />
          drown<br />
          save<br />
          be hunger<br />
          beg<br />
          forget pride<br />
          your survival is more important
        </p>

        <p>
          no one leaves home until home is a sweaty voice in your ear<br />
          saying-<br />
          leave,<br />
          run away from me now<br />
          i dont know what i’ve become<br />
          but i know that anywhere<br />
          is safer than here
