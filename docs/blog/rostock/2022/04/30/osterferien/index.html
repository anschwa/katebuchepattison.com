  <blockquote>Lots of photos again this time! <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/JYxkyu5tm2vBtsmq9">https://photos.app.goo.gl/JYxkyu5tm2vBtsmq9</a></blockquote>
  <p>I just looked back through my calendar, and it was actually only a
    week between getting back from Norway (April 4th) and then before I
    knew it we were already starting our Easter Break (Osterferien) and we
    were preparing to leave for the Netherlands. This whole year really
    has been quite a whirlwind!</p>
  <p>We did decide to just have a chill weekend in Rostock before
    gallivanting off on our next adventure, however. You maybe wouldn't
    know it from reading this blog, but in fact I am pretty much equal
    parts travel bug and couch potato. And yes, I'm aware that "travel
    bug" is usually used in the sense of a "sickness" that you catch and
    then are compelled to travel, but I like the image of a cute little
    beetle traveling the world, so I'm going with it. I am obviously
    leaning into the travel bug side of my personality this year, being
    that it is only a year that I'm on this continent with so much history
    and so many easy ways to travel and explore it all. But still. Every
    once in a while it's good to just be home and do not much of anything
    for a couple of days.</p>
  <p>The only things we got up to between Norway and the Netherlands were a
    quick trip across the river into town, where we discovered that there
    was a sizable Ostermarkt underway. The Easter market was basically
    identical to the Christmas one (down to the rainy weather) except that
    all the pine was swapped out for flowers and spring greenery, and the
    Easter bunny subbed in for the few Santa figurines that had made
    appearances in December. We strolled through, noticing most of the
    same food stands, but a few different types of decorations, namely
    garden ornaments instead of Christmas ornaments. I got myself a candle
    holder in the shape of a typical Hanseatic house, since I never
    managed to buy any souvenirs from the Christmas market before it got
    shut down.</p>
  <p>At work the Abitur season had begun, so the 12th graders were setting
    up some minor "senior prank" style shenanigans around the school. I
    can't really blame them anyway--you gotta let off some steam before
    diving into such a high-stakes testing marathon that will casually
    determine the course of the rest of your life…</p>

  </figure>
  <p>Our next big adventure began when we got up <em>really</em> early on
    Wednesday April 12th to hop on the bus that would take us to the train
    that would take us to Amsterdam and then from there on to the little
    village where the price to stay for one night was <em>less</em>
    outrageous than most of the other accommodations in the area.
    Allegedly "Tulip mania" ended in the Netherlands in the 1600s, but
    anyone trying to book lodging there during tulip season today might
    tend to conclude that prices for everything surrounding this floral
    pilgrimage are still somewhat manic…Anyway, more on that later. The
    point of this paragraph is that we had to be on the train by 6:25 AM.</p>
  <p>The upside of this early start was that when we arrived at the tiny
    train station in the village of Nieuw Vennep, just a couple stops
    outside of Amsterdam, it wasn't even 4 PM, so we had plenty of
    daylight left for exploration. The first of many very kind ("above and
    beyond" is the phrase I just keep coming back to) thing that our hosts
    did was meet us at the station and drive us the 10 minutes to their
    house, which would have taken closer to half an hour on the bus.</p>
  <p>We arrived to the charming "Blue Room" with the waiting sandwiches,
    chocolates and bottle of wine (I know right? All my other airbnb
    experiences have been "Here's the room, put the key here when you
    leave, bye!") We were then able to borrow the two bikes that Hans and
    Aly had waiting specifically for us to use, and begin our expedition
    to the coast. We debated whether it was more Gabi and Frank or
    Maggie's influence that led us to casually undertake a 40+ kilometer
    round trip bike ride to the beach, which we might not have been so
    willing to do a year ago.</p>
  <p>Although we were extremely grateful to have the bikes that enabled
    this excursion, we did have to stop and pump up the rather flat tires
    of Adam's bike at a gas station along the way (with the help of a very
    friendly Dutch family on vespas, which we discovered get to share the
    bike lanes there!) We also resolved to ask about raising the seat for
    our next day's biking adventure, since what had seemed manageable in
    the "seat slightly too low" department was pretty annoying after about
    20 km of not ever being able to fully straighten our legs when
    peddling unless we stood up…We made it though!</p>
  <p>We passed by some purple, white and pink fields full of row upon row
    of fragrant hyacinths, as well as the most beautiful garden
    round-abouts--there were daffodils, tulips and hyacinths
    <em>everywhere!</em> After only a couple of wrong turns and near
    misses of getting run over by vespas zooming past on the ubiquitous
    (but not exclusively for bicycles apparently) bike lanes, we arrived
    at the beach.</p>

    </a>
    <figcaption>This cracked me up. No free rides around here I guess, everyone has to help out!</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>We collected shells, saw a tiny starfish and equally itty-bitty crabs
    scuttling about as the sun sank toward the waves. It was lovely to
    have an active afternoon/evening after our morning of sitting on
    trains. We grabbed a light dinner of soup and salad at a beach bar and
    enjoyed the wind in our hair and the slowly cooling evening. We had to
    head back before too long though, so we wouldn't have to do the entire
    journey in the dark. Luckily our bikes had lights and the paths hand
    lamps as well, so we made it back without issues. It helped that we
    knew where we were going slightly better this time.</p>
  <p>The night had gotten a bit chilly by the time we got back, so we took
    advantage of the deep bathtub to wam up and de-sand ourselves before
    heading to bed. We also took advantage of the tiny glasses of liqueur
    and crackers set out for us as a nightcap. I'm telling you, Hans and
    Aly really made it feel much more like a traditional airbnb with all
    these extra touches.</p>
  <p>The next morning we woke up to a delectable breakfast of Aly's fresh
    waffles, bread, cheese, yogurt, granola and fruit! We also got to meet
    the guests in the other room who were a mother and daughter from
    Schleswig-Holstein (the state surrounding Hamburg.) The daughter was
    also an English teacher so we compared notes and chatted pleasantly
    through breakfast. She is apparently a big tulip fan and had been
    gifted this trip for her birthday by here mom, but it had been delayed
    a couple of years by the pandemic, so they were finally able to come
    this year. They gave us some good tips about Keukenhof, which is
    <em>the</em> place to go and see the famous tulips of Holland, where
    we were headed after finishing the meal.</p>
  <p>Hans helped us raise the seats on the bikes, so we set off in time to
    arrive at Keukenhof gardens within the window of time specified on our
    tickets. It did help that we had done a similar route the night
    before, so we were more-or-less familiar with the way. As it turned
    out, we got there slightly after our 9:30 time slot, but no one at the
    entrance seemed to care, they just scanned the QR codes on our tickets
    and waved us on in.</p>
  <p>It really was pretty cool. I don't think I've ever seen a garden that
    big, and certainly have never seen that many tulips in one place.
    There were rows and concentric circles and zig-zags of the bell shaped
    flowers in every color, as well as a rainbow of daffodils and
    hyacinths. We briefly checked out the museum where we learned about
    the Tulip mania of the mid 1600s, where the Dutch became briefly but
    completely obsessed with the bulbs. Reportedly, 40 tulip bulbs were
    once bought for 100,000 florins whereas a skilled laborer would have
    earned between 150 and 350 florins in an entire year, and on another
    occasion, just <em>two</em> bulbs were sold for a collection of goods
    worth 2,500 florins!!</p>
  <p>Tulip mania is, according to wikipedia, the first recorded instances
    of a speculative economic bubble that formed and then dramatically
    popped, leaving the "greater fools" with some wildly overpriced (if
    pretty) flowers. It's a fascinating little period of history, which
    inspired me to re-read the tulip chapter in Michael Pollan's book
"Botany of Desire" which dives into the history as well as the
sociology, psychology and biology of the plant's brief but phenomenal
success as a coveted status symbol and luxury item, and then its more
modest but still steady favoritism in spring gardens to this day.</p>
<p>We learned a bit about the history of the tulip and the "lasagna
planting method" in which bulbs are planted in the fall in layers so
that the top layer will bloom, die, and then be replaced by the layer
below resulting in a garden in constant bloom for months. We then left
the museum portion and ventured out to explore the extensive gardens
themselves. There were fountains, ponds, paths, a gigantic automated
calliope wagon thing that piped out cheery tunes in one corner of the
vast maze of flowers. We strolled through it all, Adam very patiently
indulging my desire to see each bed, though he did eventually impose a
selfie cap for the day (I think after the 5th he said I got 3 more.)
We strolled and I took hundreds of photos and sniffed the blooms (it
turns out they don't smell like much) and eventually headed back to
our bikes after nearly 3 hours.</p>

<p>Our next stop was the Keukenhof castle, just down the road. We didn't
go inside but walked around the stately house and enjoyed the statues
and garden paths. As a girl from a very land-locked portion of the US,
I was somewhat astounded by the gravel on the walkways, since it was
made up mostly of partially crushed shells. To me seashells are the
treasures of the beach, not something to be crushed casually
underfoot! But when the ocean is so close, I suppose one could grow a
bit immune to the wonders even of shells.</p>
<p>The sky was getting ominously gray by the time we headed out, but
luckily we only got hit with a few sprinkles on the ride back. We
therefore stopped on the way to pick up some picnic lunch supplies. I
was impressed with the fancy re-useable sporks the grocery store just
gave us too, and they have come in handy in picnics since. We then sat
by a canal and watched some kids rescue a bike that was stranded in a
bush while we ate.</p>
<p>Back at the airbnb, we spent a relaxing afternoon researching and
planning out a general overview for the next day's adventures in
Amsterdam. The sun came back out, so we were able to do the majority
of this planning in the sunny little garden outside our room, which
was rather nice. The sun stuck around into the evening as well, so we
took a nice long stroll through the cute little village. I was a bit
surprised to see that the majority of the houses seemed to be
<em>right</em> on the sidewalk, with not even a little buffer of yard
as separation, and then they also had gigantic front windows with no
curtains! I just felt like I was practically walking through
everyone's living rooms as we went down the streets…</p>
<p>We picked up some more grocery store ingredients to throw together
into a nice dinner back in the common kitchenette area outside our
room. We then enjoyed the wine in the garden as the evening wound to a
close. We were in bed before it was too late, since there was another
big day ahead of us.</p>
<p>The next morning we woke up to another fabulous breakfast from Aly
(scrambled eggs as well as fruit torte this time) and then we packed
up and Hans drove us to the train station for a surprisingly sunny day
in Amsterdam. Upon arrival, we stashed our bags in lockers at the
Amsterdam train station where our overnight train would leave that
evening, and set off with our day packs into the city.</p>

</figure>
<p>Our day mostly involved wandering around enjoying the sunshine,
abundance of canals and large parks. We also walked through the
floating flower market. I was expecting to see mostly fresh flowers,
but actually the majority of stands had bulbs and garden supplies as
well as the typical touristy souvenir stuff. It was neat to walk
through though.</p>
<p>We also stopped by Begijnhof, which is a remarkably quiet courtyard in
the middle of the bustling city. From the late sixteenth century up
until nearly 1800 Catholics were not allowed to openly practice their
religion, as Amsterdam had become a protestant city, but Begijnhof was
an exception to the general ban. As the plaque at the entrance
informed us, Begijnhof was home to "pious catholic single women who
preformed good deeds but did not want to live in a convent and did not
take vows" and we were asked to stay respectfully quiet because women
still live in the houses today. We walked through one of the churches
and also saw one of the city's oldest surviving wooden houses, dating
from 1475. It's pretty bananas to realize that that building has been
there since before Europeans were even in the Americas.</p>
<p>We actually ended up stumbling across the National Holocaust Monument
which was interesting to see as well. It has walls shaped like the
Hebrew letters for "In Memoriam" covered in the names of the victims,
and topped with mirrored panels. We also visited the so called
"Homomonument" in the shape of a pink granite triangle, in honor of
members of the LGBTQ+ community who were forced by the Nazis to wear
pink triangles on their clothes, similar to the yellow stars of David
that Jews were made to wear. We also saw Anne Frank's house, though we
decided not to wait in the hours long line to go inside, since we only
had one day in the city and wanted to enjoy the sunshine.</p>
<p>We attempted to go to the Botanical garden as well, but it was on an
island that you had to pay to get onto, as far as we could see, so we
sat by the canal and had our picnic and drank our Heineken, admiring
the outside of the gigantic greenhouse. It had a large sign saying
">375 Jaar" which given Dutch's similarity to German can only mean
that's how many years it's been around--rather impressive.</p>
<p>We rounded off the day by heading to the public library which has an
impressive view of the city from its top floor. We also enjoyed the
photo exhibition there, which displayed family portraits of recently
fled refugee families on the Greek island of Lesbos. The same families
were then photographed again in their new homes, mostly in various
western European countries. It was impressive to see so many smiles on
the faces of people who had so recently been through what was likely
the worst experience of their lives. It really underlines the
resiliency of the human spirit, and humanizes the often faceless
"refugee problem." It's a good reminder that these are families we are
talking about.</p>
<p>Even though no one else in the library was wearing a mask, we felt
like it was the safe option, given how much travel was coming up, and
how inconvenient it would be to catch covid. What was also
inconvenient was that we realized we were rather sunburned after our
day exploring the city under a surprisingly cloudless sky. A mask
trapping your hot breath agains your sunburned cheeks is not that fun,
let me tell you.</p>
<p>Before long it was time to head back to the station, pick up our bags
from the lockers, and board our train. We left Amsterdam Central
Station at 8:30 pm, and were luckily able to sleep fairly well, since
we each had two seats to ourselves until we arrived in Bonn just after
midnight. It did feel like a looong layover as we waited for our next
train which wouldn't depart until 1:40 am. We strolled around the
mostly sleeping city and were approached by an extremely drunk man who
offered us a glittery plastic Easter bunny. We politely declined and
headed back to the station to wait it out.</p>
<p>We were again able to sleep on the way to Hamburg, where we arrived
just before 7 am. We then had another layover and eventually made it
back home to Rostock by 10ish. It had been a long night, but we felt
like we had packed a lot into our short trip to the Netherlands, to be
sure. The beach, the tulips and Amsterdam!</p>
<p>The nice thing was that I had almost the entire next week off of work,
because there was no school until Wednesday, and my normal Thursday
off meant I only had one class on Friday. We didn't do much to
celebrate Easter, just had a quiet weekend and rested up after our big
adventure, mostly.</p>
<p>By Tuesday we were ready for another mini-adventure, so we biked to
the Rostock Hauptbahnhof and hopped on the train to Güstrow. The main
idea was to explore the castle there, so we were rather disappointed
to find it under construction when we arrived. Luckily it was a lovely
day, so we had a nice time strolling around anyway.</p>
<p>We were somewhat shocked to see a building bearing the name
"Reichsbahnamt" still standing near the train station too. Literally
translated it means "Reich's train office" and although I didn't know
the exact history of that office, the mere presence of the word
"Reich" carved in stone on a building right on one of the main streets
of a German town in 2022 was jarring, and I couldn't quite believe
what I was seeing at first.</p>
<figure>
  <a href="img/05_gustrow-reichsbahnamt.jpg">
    <img alt="Building with the German word  Reichsbahnamt carved above the door" src="img/thumbs/05_gustrow-reichsbahnamt.jpg" />
  </a>
  <figcaption>Yikes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After some research it seems that, although the office of the German
national railway was founded well before WWII in 1919, during the Nazi
period it was taken over and the Deutsche Reichsbahn became
instrumental in the transportation of thousands of Jews to
concentration camps. Yikes. And there was no plaque contextualizing
this ugly piece of history either. I mean luckily the eagle perched
over the word wasn't clutching a swastika, but still… It just seems
like something that should either be taken down or turned into some
sort of memorial.</p>
<p>Then again, my own country still has statues of confederate generals
being explicitly honored, and <em>that</em> ugly piece of history is
nearly 100 years older than the Holocaust, so I suppose I shouldn't
point fingers. Anyway, this was a strange start to our Güstrow trip.</p>
<p>We did see the cathedral, which was nice as well as the gardens of the
  castle, which were also nice. We could even see into a couple of rooms
  of the castle as well, and they had nicely put up a print of what the
  scaffolding was covering over, so we got a general idea of what we
  were missing out on. We strolled through the town a bit before heading
  back to the station and to Rostock.</p>
<p>And that pretty much concludes Easter break- we spent the next couple
  of days relaxing and preparing for a visit from Mara and Maggie the
  following weekend. But that is the subject of the next entry.</p>
