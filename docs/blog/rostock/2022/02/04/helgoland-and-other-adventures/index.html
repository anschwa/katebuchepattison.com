  <p>
    After Mara and Maggie headed back to Hamburg, the first few weeks of
    January were really quite uneventful. I settled back into the school
    routine, pretty much. We finished reading a book with Daniela (one
    of the English teachers') advanced 11th grade course, and I started
    working more regularly with Ireen's 7th graders too. I got tricked
    by a few sunny days that enticed me out for a bike ride even though
    the path by the river was completely flooded…soggy Birkenstocks
    are no fun.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 15th (a Saturday) it was extra sunny, so I figured I owed it
    to myself to get outside for the day. I biked around to the other
    side of the river and walked around the very expansive IGA Park.
    I'll definitely be going back sometime when its warmer, since the
    sun didn't quite outweigh the bitter wind whipping off the water. It
    was still a nice excursion and I enjoyed the solo adventure and all
    the fresh air.
  </p>

  <p>
    Daniela had mentioned that her birthday was in January, so as I was
    procrastinating on finishing the socks I had been working on
    knitting for almost two years, I decided to knit her a little apple,
    as sort of a "happy birthday/you are a good teacher!" present. I
    found a simple and free pattern and got to work. Knitting is my
    excuse for sitting around and watching Netflix or listening to
    audiobooks for hours on end, because that way I can tell myself I'm
    not <em>really</em> being lazy if I'm also making something.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was on the phone with my German friend Ellen (my loyal readers may
    remember that she is the one who visited right after we moved to
    Gehlsdorf) and it occurred to me to ask if the association between
    teachers and apples was as prominent here. Her complete confusion
    was answer enough: not only is the connection not as strong as it is
    in the US, she had never heard of teachers and apples being at all
    associated with each other. Huh. Just when I get to thinking that
    Germany and the US really aren't so different at all, something that
    is so unquestionable to me is completely absent here.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was good that I mentioned it to Ellen, since without my
    explanatory note, Daniela would have probably been super confused.
    Even with her long experience in the US, Selina later confirmed that
    she had never heard of the apple-teacher connection either. A
    cursory google search revealed that the association between apples
    and educators in the US comes from the frontier days when teachers
    didn't have salaries, but were fed and housed by donations from the
    local community, such as apples. Well Germany never had a "frontier"
    in the way the US did, so I suppose the difference makes sense. It's
    just funny to me how obvious the connection was for me that it took
    me several hours of knitting a tiny apple before it even occurred to
    me to wonder if maybe this custom wasn't as universal as it seemed.
    Daniela was pleased with it though, and it was sort of a cool
    cross-cultural moment, since she'd also never heard of the
    connection either and she liked the idea of "keeping the teacher
    healthy" with apples.
  </p>

      />
    </a>

    <figcaption>It tuned out to be pretty cute I think</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Midway through the month, Selina reached out and proposed working
    from <em>my</em> home for the last week of January, so that her
    visit could encompass two weekends without having to take time off
    to come see me. I was thrilled with the idea. After discovering what
    should have been obvious: that procrastination does not lead to
    cheap flight options, we decided I would have to break my "one
    international trip per month" streak for January. We instead made
    arrangements to make a longtime dream of Selina's come true: seeing
    baby seals in the wild.
  </p>

  <p> Thus it was that on the 21st of January, I packed my trusty middle
    school backpack that has become my go-to weekend bag, and boarded
    the train for Hamburg. I showed up at Maggie's apartment and met her
    roommate for the first time, since even though I had been to visit
    her several times already, Sabine had never been there for me to
    actually meet. We had grand plans to go out and explore and whatnot,
    but since it was essentially dark by the time I arrived, we ended up
    being a bit lazy and just chatting in her room until it was time to
    head back to the Hauptbahnhof to meet Selina.
  </p>

  <p>
    After some discussion, we dropped off Selina's luggage at Maggies's
    then went and got her and I covid tests. She needed hers for both
    the hotel on Helgoland the next day, and also that night's
    restaurant, since she didn't have her booster yet. At the last
    minute I decided I might as well schedule one for myself, since I
    hadn't ended up teaching that day's planned lesson, due to the whole
    11th grade being in quarantine. We were both negative—whew!
  </p>

  <p>
    We had some tasty Asian food—the restaurant was
    "Vietnamese-Chinese-Thai-Nepalese" so, a lot going on… It turned
    out to be pretty good, despite Selina's skepticism that a single
    restaurant could do all of those things well. We hung out and
    chatted at the restaurant for a long time, such that it was pretty
    much bedtime when we got back to Maggie's room.
  </p>

  <p>
    Things had been upgraded since the last time I slept on Maggie's
    floor however, since she had found a thick sort of exercise mat on
    the street on one of her runs in Rostock, and after thoroughly
    sanitizing it, I was able to more comfortably sleep. There was of
    course the inevitable chatting and giggling before any sleep
    actually happened though. Before long, Selina and my alarms were
    ringing in unison, and we had to get up, pack up and head for the
    train again.
  </p>

  <p>
    We had time to stop at the grocery store (which was surprisingly
    busy for that early on a Saturday) and pick up some breakfast and
    picnic lunch supplies for ourselves before boarding our train from
    Hamburg to Cuxhaven. The ride was about 2 hours, and by the time we
    finished our breakfast and did some chatting, we were already
    pulling in to the station in the costal town that looked decidedly
    sleepy in January.
  </p>

  <p>
    After a small moment of confusion, we eventually found the bus stop
    that would deliver us to the ferry dock. We were surprised to see
    that evidently some of the other passengers had been on board for a
    while, since we saw some empty plates in the dining area when I went
    down to stop off at the bathroom. After this though, we quickly
    scouted out a place above decks since neither of us wanted to tempt
    sea sickness.
  </p>

  <p>
    All the benches were wet, and it was lightly raining and <em>so windy</em> and
    therefore rather cold. But we hunkered down into our scarves and
    once we were able to relocate to a spot somewhat sheltered from the
    wind and rain, we even managed to curl up around our luggage and let
    the waves rock us to sleep for a short nap. We even caught a glimpse
    of a rainbow as the clouds cleared.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because I never managed to dig out a hair band from my bag in a bag
    in a bag where it was tucked away, my hair looked like a
    windswept…seagull nest? by the time we landed. But hey, we had
    gotten some fresh air and most importantly neither of us got seasick!
  </p>

      />
    </a>

    <figcaption>My hair is somewhat wild on the best of days, but this was a whole new level</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Upon arrival, we ate some bread, cheese and tomatoes on a sunny
    bench by the water, before heading to check-in at our hotel. After
    getting the paperwork settled, we dropped our bags in our cute
    little top-floor room with a lovely skylight view of the water, and
    set out to explore the tiny island.
  </p>

  <p>
    We used the voucher we had gotten from the hotel to take the
    elevator up to the upper level of the island, because why not? We
    then set off along the winding windswept path that traced the upper
    edges of the lovely reddish rocky cliffs. Seeing the fearless dining
    habits of the sheep delicately feasting on the <em>very</em> edge of
    a heart-stompingly sheer drop-off to the waves crashing below
    reminded me of being on the Shetland islands. We didn't witness any
    ruminants plummet to their death, luckily, but we did enjoy some
    stunning views of blue ocean and blue sky.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventually, we wandered our way down to a wide beach with a thick
    carpet of seaweed near the crashing waves. As it tuned out it also
    had a sandy surface farther in studded with a surprising amount of
    green, white and brown sea glass. We meandered along, collecting our
    handfuls of treasures as our fingers slowly turned numb and we
    breathed in delicious lungfuls of fresh sea air. It was nearly dark
    by the time we finished our circuit of the island and made it back
    to our room.
  </p>

      />
    </a>

    <figcaption>We ended up with at least twice this many treasures by the time we headed back</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    After a quick mishap where we locked ourselves out of the hotel room
    (oops) we signed up for a time-slot in the hotel's sauna before
    setting out to grab some snacks. We crunched on some convenience
    store treats as we explored the restaurant possibilities for later
    that evening. We identified several promising prospects before it
    was time for our sauna appointment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Upon being confronted with the staggeringly dry heat wave of the
    sauna, Selina (who had never been to one before) coughed and asked
    if I was trying to kill her. I assured her I wasn't and we
    eventually settled in for a short stint in the overwhelming heat. It
    really is an astonishing sensation: the cedar-y heat does almost
    choke you at first, until you learn to trust that you really can
    breath the shockingly hot air. We could feel our faces turning red,
    and a fine layer of sweat developing over our bodies. I normally
    don't like being overheated. I guess maybe I'm a product of the
    upper midwest: I prefer the cold, where I can always add more
    clothes to be comfortable over the heat where you can only take off
    so many layers. There is something wonderful about surrendering to
    the heat though— it's sort of freeing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before too long, the sips of cold water from my bottle were not
    enough, so we left the sauna and draped a strange array of clothes
    over our swimsuits before sneaking out for the short walk to the
    beach we had found earlier in the day. Well, it felt like we were
    breaking some sort of rule as we crept out of the hotel into the
    darkness in our strange mix of summer and winter-wear, even though
    we were actually doing nothing wrong.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chilly January night air felt so refreshing on our overheated
    skin as we made the short walk to the bitterly cold North Sea
    waves that lapped up on the darkened beach. We carefully picked
    our way down the sandy path, Selina trusting me to lead the way,
    since only I had my glasses and phone flashlight. We made a bundle
    of our towels and outer layers on top of our shoes, then took a
    deep breath, held hands, and ran into the frigid waves, trying not
    to shriek too loudly. Neither of us wanted to get our hair wet, so
    we made it past the belly-button point, before our toes were
    already numb and we retreated. We both gasped and splashed our way
    back out, before agreeing that that wasn't quite enough to count
    as a real swim… So we dashed back into the icy surf and ducked
    down to our shoulders this time, suppressing our howls from the
    cold and dashing back out to our dry layers and a hasty trip back
    to the sauna.
  </p>

  <p>
    The heat was welcome this time, after our freezing dip. It still
    wasn't long before we were overheated and ready for showers and some
    dinner. The showers hadn't done much to cool us down again so we
    were sort of looking forward to the chilly walk up to the restaurant
    we had found before. We shared an entree and an appetizer as we
    chatted, slowly returning to a normal body temperature as the meal
    wound to a close, and we headed back to the room.
  </p>

  <p>
    We broke into the chocolate part of the snacks we had gotten earlier
    as we got ready for bed. I made myself do a few rows of knitting on
    the socks I had <em>finally</em> continued working on, since I had
    bothered to drag them all the way up to the island. We watched the
    first episode of "On My Block" which is a show I subsequently have
    gotten very sucked into, and am now almost finished watching all
    four seasons of, at the time of writing…We eventually brushed our
    teeth and snuggled into bed. Despite the fact that we had spend most
    of the day sitting on trains and boats, we still managed to get
    pretty tired between the walking, wind and drastic temperature
    changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    We woke up early and the kind hotel staff let us start eating the
    delicious breakfast before it was technically open. We enjoyed the
    flaky mini-croissants, tomatoes, cucumbers, cheese, bread, eggs and
    even mimosas! We had made arrangements to check out early the day
    before, so we dropped off our key cards and stashed our bags in the
    luggage room before dashing down to the harbor. We jogged up only to
    find that we had juuuust missed the ferry to the other island for
    the seal-watching extravaganza. It was a lovely morning though, so
    we enjoyed the last glow of sunrise over the water as we waited for
    the next boat.
  </p>

  <p>
    It turned out that "ferry" might have been a generous term for the
    tiny boat that took us and a few middle-aged ladies across to the
    "Helgoland Dunes" island. We were, as a rule a good 20-40 years
    younger than everyone we had run into on the island, aside from the
    poor boy who had been blushingly urged to share the elevator with
    the "judge Danmen" by his winking older companions the night before.
  </p>

  <p>
    We made it to the neighbor island in a matter of minutes, and were
    walking over the pleasantly firm sand towards, we hoped, some seals.
    It didn't take long for us to notice the group of our ferry-mates
    gathered around something, so we turned back and squinted at the
    pale sand until we noticed that one of the lumpy rocks was wiggling
    a bit. It was a little baby! It's still-white fur made it blend into
    the post-dawn dimness on the west side of the island. We kept our
    respectful 30 meters of distance as we watched the little creature
    flop and flounder, trying, presumably, to get a little more sleep
    before facing the day.
  </p>

  <p>
    We took the boardwalk up across the top of the dunes, reveling in
    the dazzling rising sun in the clear sky. It was shocking to come up
    over a rise in the path and be confronted with this little fellow,
    really quite close to us. We couldn't really have kept the 30 meters
    distance in this case, at least not without scrambling off the path
    and down the other side of the dunes. Instead, we just quietly
    watched he/she/it/they for a moment before moving on.
  </p>

      />
    </a>

    <figcaption>I mean what a cutie, right?</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    As we continued on we ran across increasing numbers of rocks on
    the beach that turned out to be a whole…bunch? of seals. Ok I had
    to look it up just now, but it turns out that, according to the
    internet, there are eight different collective noun options for
    seals! I will attempt to use them all here, so stay tuned. We were
    delighted to round a corner and come across a bob of seals
    sprawled out in their adorable blob-ish awkwardness on the sand.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was fun to notice the colony become more active as we watched
    them. Every once and a while one or a few would break off from the
    crash and galumph their way towards the waves, inevitably forming a
    mini harem halfway to the water when their ungainly
    land-transportation became too exhausting. Once they actually got to
    the water, their body shapes suddenly transformed into a design so
    obviously graceful that it was hard to reconcile them with the
    blundering lumps on shore.
  </p>

  <p>
    As we kept strolling around the perimeter of beaches, we also got to
    see the transformation in reverse, as they left the water, their fur
    now sleek as they emerged to rejoin the herd sunning themselves on
    the sand. It was extra cute to see them greet a member of their pod
    as they flopped themselves back up the beach. We only saw one other
    baby in one of the smaller rookeries farther along the beach though.
    Apparently baby seals grow up fast, since they are normally born
    between November and January, but in late January we only saw two
    white-furred little ones, in all the springs of seals we saw that
    day. Maybe they had set off to form their own "kids table" of seals
    somewhere?

  <p>
    After completing our sunny and windy circuit of the island, we got
    back on the tiny ferry once again and headed back to the main
    island. Once there, we picked up our bags and started towards the
    big ferry. We were somewhat early, so we decided to duck into a cafe
    for a quick drink before boarding the next boat.
  </p>

  <p>
    Selina opted for a latte I think, but since I had been seeing signs
    advertising the "Helgoländer Eiergrog" which I imagined to be some
    sort of specialty eggnog, I had to go for that. I always try to
    order the weirdest thing on the menu and/or the thing I wouldn't be
    able to get anywhere else, so it had to happen.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the time our drinks showed up, we didn't actually have all that
    much time before we needed to get on the boat after all. This made
    it quite the challenge for me, generally a notably slow
    eater/drinker to rapidly guzzle my…yah, it was definitely a
    cocktail, especially since it turned out to be extremely foamy, with
    tiny flecks of egg yolk and <em>lots</em> of rum. Quite the combo.
    Glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll be repeating the experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    I just now looked up a recipe and the YouTube video said "You could
    have one or maybe two of these, but three is really the limit,
    unless you want to be dancing on the table in your underwear." I
    certainly just had the one, but drinking it quickly on an empty
    stomach…well lets just say I tottered my way to the boat and had a
    nice long nap curled up with my backpack on the deck.
  </p>

  <p>
    The funniest part though, was that right after we paid and were
    setting off with our bags in tow, following the general stream of
    people toward the docks, I was discussing the flavor of the drink
    with Selina. In the middle of my sentence the most gigantic burp
    snuck up on me, and had rumbled forth before I could close my mouth.
    It was so loud. Selina nearly fell over she was laughing so hard. I
    like to think <em>that</em> was why so many people were staring at us…
  </p>

  <p>
    The ferry ride was sunnier than the trip to the island had been, not
    that I was awake for much of it…Selina went inside the door so she
    was still on the top deck but out of the wind to finish her book
    while I napped.
  </p>

  <p>
    Upon arrival back on the mainland, we took the bus only part of the
    way back up to the train station in Cuxhaven, so we also got to
    stroll through the cute little off-season tourist town. We made it
    back to the Hauptbahnhof (or maybe the only Bahnhof, actually, it is
    a pretty small town) in plenty of time, even after a bakery/bathroom
    pit-stop.
  </p>

  <p>
    The ride was rather lengthy since both of the trains (from Cuxhaven
    to Hamburg, and from Hamburg to Rostock) were RE or "Regional
    Express" rather than ICE "Inter City Express". Frankly, I think they
    just tack the word express onto the name of the regional trains to
    make you feel better, because it's really express in name only. They
    serve everyone in the region, so they make lots of stops. As someone
    who grew up in a small town, there is part of me that really
    appreciates that there are trains here that stop in the little
    villages, allowing public transit to be actually useful to everyone.
    But when you're just going from one big city to another…
  </p>

  <p>
    I recently learned another expression for referring to regional
    trains from Gabi as we chatted over coffee after school the other
    day. She said those trains "stop at every milk can" which is from a
    time when the farmers used to collect their milk into those big cans
    and the train would apparently stop and load up all of them. This is
    added to the expression that made me laugh way back in high school
    when a classmate said we shouldn't take a particular train because
    it "stopped at every fat tree." I guess maybe Germans are impatient,
    to have multiple saying expressing the slowness of certain trains,
    but it is kind of frustrating to travel a long distance, especially
    when it's late and you are tired from the trip and just wanna be <em>home</em> already
    but you have to make so. Many. Stops….
  </p>

  <p>
    We got fairly lucky once we finally did arrive in Rostock though,
    since we didn't have to wait at all for the tram, and only a few
    minutes for the bus before getting home at last. We where too lazy
    to set up the guest bed, so even though we both had work in the
    morning, Selina bunked with me and we started the routine of
    staying up way too late chatting. The whole week honestly felt
    like one big middle school sleepover in that sense—it was great.
  </p>

  <p>
    On Monday, we quickly learned that if either of us were going to get
    any actual work done during the day (editing a research paper for
    her, and lesson planning for me) we had to be in separate rooms,
    because otherwise we would just talk. They were fun distracting
    discussions about everything from politics to books to inequality in
    the world, but it was not conducive to being productive. So, falling
    back on our college study habits, I snuggled up with my laptop in
    the cozy living room chair, swaddled in a blanket. She swore she
    would fall asleep if she got too comfortable, so she set up camp by
    the window in the kitchen instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    We got into a nice routine of eating a late lunch together after I
    got back from my afternoon class, then getting a couple more hours
    of work done (some days were more productive than others.) We even
    did some of my yoga and her workout videos too, since the weather
    did not encourage going out to explore the town too much.
  </p>

  <p>
    We did finally manage to venture across the river to explore the
    Altstadt a bit on Wednesday. We combined some preliminary wedding
    dress shopping with craft night, because why not? It was quite the
    experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have rarely been in a place that screamed "classy and girly" so
    loudly, with all of the blush pinks and rose-gold accents, lace, and
    flowers. Upon arrival, after showing our vaccine passes, our coats
    were hung up for us and we were led to the "Gold Room" where we set
    the rest of our stuff, before browsing through the tall racks of
    elegant white dresses.

      It certainly seemed to be styled like it's American counterparts,
      which was somewhat ironic, since that's the place the wedding will
      actually happen.

    After selecting an array of gowns in the vein olf the ones Selina had
    shown me the night before while we accidentally let the vegan
    oatmeal cookies (our contribution to the coming craft night feast)
    burn into horribly hard little hockey pucks. Seriously, they were
    awful. I normally try to eat even my worst baking disasters, but
    after sampling one I put them straight in the compost. I do have a
    theory that two ingredient cookies might have been too good to be
    true, even if we hadn't inadvertently tripled the baking time
    though. But ANYWAY, we had looked at some photos the night before,
    so I would know the styles of dresses she was interested in and
    looking for. We therefore selected an array of similar styles as
    well as a few random ones just to see how they would feel.
  </p>

  <p>
    What we learned: her instincts were correct, and she liked wearing
    what she thought she would. Most lace is horribly itchy. Trains are
    hard to walk in. Veils can actually be nicer than expected. I was
    the designated documentary photographer, and had a nice time
    munching on the elegant tower of chocolatey snacks they provided us
    with, between dresses.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once we emerged from "Bride Stories" back onto the windy streets of
    the old town, we had a little while to tour Selina through the main
    sights of the city center, even though it was dark by that time. We
    fought our way through the wind on the harbor, which included an
    epic mask-chase when the wind whipped it off my wrist and I had to
    run after it all the way to the water's edge where it had finally
    gotten caught in some bushes. It really felt like something out of a
    silent comedy movie: I would almost catch it, and another gust would
    whisk it out of my reach. After these adventures, we eventually made
    it to Amber's, that week's craft night host.
  </p>

  <p>
    We introduced Selina to everyone, and met Amber's coworker Diego,
    who would be joining our crafting ranks. Burritos were enjoyed by
    all—a very welcome treat after being essentially cut off from
    trustworthy Mexican food for months. As the much more successful
    lime-ginger vegan shortbread cookies I had made that morning to
    replace the oatmeal banana abominations were passed around, I taught
    Selina to knit.
  </p>

  <p>
    About half an hour and and several successful rows later, she
    declared knitting very stressful "there's so much to keep track of!"
    and while I promised it got easier as your skills improved, she
    decided she needed to take a break. I was just impressed at her
    progress. It turns out it's a lot easier to teach adults how to knit
    than third graders, as I attempted while subbing last year. 8-9 year
    olds attention span, frustration threshold and fine motor control
    are just much more limited.
  </p>

  <p>
    The excessive wind meant we couldn't take the ferry home, but the
    tram/bus combo did the trick without issues, since it wasn't a
    Monday protest day. We finally managed to get to bed early-ish that
    night, since my 8am class that day had caught up with me.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thursday and Friday were fairly uneventful and rainy, so we just
    stayed in and hung out. Friday was the epitome of a night-in-party
    though. We made some mushroom risotto for dinner, while rocking out
    to a variety of nostalgic and new dance tunes. The risotto turned
    out rather gluey since we apparently cooked it too long, perhaps
    because we were too busy dancing and drinking the dirty martinis
    that Selina had wanted to try for a long time, to notice how long we
    had been stirring and stirring and stirring the rice…We ate in
    nevertheless, and at least the flavor was good, even if the texture
    was off.
  </p>

  <p>
    We then took our martinis into the living room, pumped up the jams,
    and continued our dance party. We took advantage of the space
    available, not being in a crowded club, and boogied all over the
    place. By the end of the night Selina was becoming convinced that
    she might want to have dancing be part of her wedding too, so maybe
    no elopement after all…
  </p>

  <p>
    Saturday brought an impressive wind-storm, even for Rostock, where
    gustiness is the norm. It was so intense in fact that Selina's
    Sunday morning train back southwest to Frankfurt was delayed and
    then canceled. She eventually had to go west by first going east to
    Berlin.
  </p>

  <p>
    The week after Selina left was pretty standard. I redeemed myself by
    making risotto of the proper consistency when I hosted Wednesday
    night's craft night though, which was nice. It was also fun to play
    salad bowl with Gabi's 11th graders, with the focus on German
    stereotypes. Fascinating to see what they thought were typical
    German things, versus what I would have said.
  </p>

  <p>
    We had been talking about national identity with the class the week
    before, and I had also done a really interesting activity (if I do
    say so myself) where they positioned themselves in different corners
    of the room depending on if they identified more with being a
    "Mecklenburger," (someone from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern) an East
    German, a German, or a European. I was fascinated by how many
    identified as either European and East German, which I wasn't
    expecting. I guess just because there is no "North American Union"
    in the way there is a European one, so I had never even considered
    my identity on a continental level. Also interesting that so many of
    the students identified with a former country that had never even
    existed in their lifetimes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Daniela invited me to watch the 12th grade play on Friday evening as
    well, which was quite fun. I was looking forward to it even more
    when I found the mini champagne bottles she had stashed on the
    outside windowsill of the language office lounge to have it nice and
    chilled for after the show.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is such an interesting insight into the much more relaxed
    attitude toward alcohol here, were the drinking age for beer and
    wine in 16, and the subject is far less taboo in general. When
    Gabi heard about it, she just chuckled and wished us a good time,
    which needless to say would <em>not</em> have been the response if
    a department head found a staff member stashing alcohol on school
    premises in the US. To be fair, the room stays locked whenever
    there isn't a staff member in it, so it's not like any of the
    students could have gotten to it even if they had know it was
    there. And anyway, half the students in that building could
    legally drink it anyway!
  </p>

      />
    </a>

    <figcaption>You know it's almost break when teachers are bringing the party to the school</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Since she was headed out early the next morning for her much-needed
    vacation (we have the middle two weeks of February off) Gabi
    couldn't make it to the play, so instead her and I walked over to a
    nearby bakery/cafe and had some pastries and warm drinks after
    school. It was nice to chat with her, as always, and she pointed out
    some prime hiking spots on the map she had lent me for my upcoming
    hiking adventure.
  </p>

  <p>
    The play was quite well done. It's always neat to watch students
    that you see everyday take on new roles onstage, and they did a
    great job leaning-in to the dark psychological thriller side of the
    story of "Der Sandmann." It's one of those stories that walks the
    line between hallucination and reality, and it's often unclear what
    is <em>really</em> happening, and what is a representation of what's
    going on in the characters' heads. There was impressive sound and
    lighting as well, and even a dry-ice machine! I can't remember the
    last time I saw a live show either—certainly pre-covid—and the
    palpable energy of having the performers in the same room is always
    exhilarating.
  </p>

  <p>
    After applauding and congratulating the students, a few of the
    teachers headed upstairs to sip some of the champagne out of what
    are normally our coffee mugs—a bit of a surreal experience. Daniela
    (ever prepared) even had some pretzels for us to munch on while we
    relaxed and chatted about school and the upcoming break we were
    easing into. Daniela was kind enough to drive me home after we
    wrapped up. A lovely way to end the week and begin the vacation.
  </p>

  <p>
    And that, folks, is me caught up on my blog. Whew! That was a long
    one, thanks for sticking with me. <em>At last</em> that brings us to
    today, a few mostly uneventful days later. I talked to a few
    friends, did some yoga, went on a short bike ride, got some new yarn
    and most of all, did a lot of blogging.
  </p>

  <p>
    Right now I sit waiting for the last of my laundry to dry, listening
    to odd instrumental covers of pop songs so the lyrics don't distract
    me as I wrap this up, and move on to packing for yet another
    adventure. But that's another post.
