  <p>
    Hello everybody! This is a link to the photos, as usual:

  </p>

  <p>
    The Tuesday after Maggie left (after our bike tour) Adam and I
    went back to the Christmas market for our residence permit
    appointment at the migration office. We had been researching for
    weeks leading up to this about what documents Adam would need,
    since his situation is a bit more complicated than mine. We were
    pretty sure we had everything we would need for his &ldquo;looking for
    work visa&rdquo; which seemed like the simplest application route that
    would allow him to stay here with me. Since he doesn&rsquo;t have a
    job here and we aren&rsquo;t married, which would have allowed him to
    stay for &ldquo;family reasons&rdquo; none of the well-known channels were
    open to him. We got to the appointment early and after two
    different people verified our appointment registration number,
    we were showed into a waiting room.
  </p>

  <p>
    My residence permit went off without a hitch, because Fulbright
    had told me exactly which documents I would need, and the fact
    that I am here through that program smoothed the process
    considerably, so my paperwork took less than 5 minutes to sort
    out. Not so much in Adam&rsquo;s case. They told us that the
    Arbeitsuchendevisum (looking for work visa) would be more
    complicated, but we had some other options. They informed us
    that he needed a &ldquo;reason to stay&rdquo; and when Adam responded that I
    was his reason, that was not considered legally sufficient. They
    advised him to sign up for an intensive German language course,
    and said that <em>that</em> would count as a reason. We would be
    able to just email the class registration form along with the
    copies of Adam&rsquo;s passport etc. to the migration office email they
    gave us and we would be set to go, they said. Optimist that I am,
    I thought: &ldquo;No problem, we&rsquo;ll just walk over to the
    Volkshochschule, where they have these kinds of German classes,
    and sign him up, and he can take the ferry over for class
    everyday, it&rsquo;ll be great!&rdquo; Well it didn&rsquo;t quite work out that
    way, alas.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not only was the woman in charge of signing people up for classes
    on vacation for the next week, the next beginner level intensive
    German class didn&rsquo;t start until February….So I emailed the
    migration office back, asking if that would work, and if not, what
    other options we had&mdash;would an online class work, as a
    stop-gap before that one began? But I heard…nothing…back…and
    the clock was ticking. We had made the first available residence
    permit appointment that we could, but it was only a few days
    before our 90 days (the amount of time you are allowed to be in
    Germany as a tourist from the USA without a visa) were up. So if
    we didn&rsquo;t hear back soon, we concluded, he would have to leave by
    the end of the week, or else stay in the country illegally,
    potentially barring him from ever coming back in the future when
    he was inevitably caught when flying out of the country. And being
    Germany, they are pretty serious about their rules.
  </p>

  <p>
    So it was a tense week. It felt a bit like the period after I
    found out I had gotten the Fulbright, but before I knew any
    information about where or what kind of school I would be at or
    any of the relevant detail that would allow us to move forward and
    envision what the next several months would look like. There was a
    lot to do, but we couldn&rsquo;t make any moves without some answers.
    After calling every language school in Rostock, and even
    considering commuting to Berlin or Hamburg, each option more
    expensive and inconvenient than the last, and as the days rolled
    on, things started to look pretty grim.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was hard to feel grateful then, on Thanksgiving, when instead
    of celebrating with friends or family, we were looking at flights
    for Adam to leave the country on short notice. The rules had
    changed in the past couple of years too, so that one could no
    longer just leave the &ldquo;Shengan Zone&rdquo; (a group of European
    countries with similar visa rules) and come back the next day, and
    your 90 day visa-free period would begin again. Now the rule is
    called the 90/180 rule, so that within each 180 day period, you
    can be in the Shengan Zone for 90 days. In other words, you can
    come and stay for 3 months, but then you have to leave and stay
    away for another 3 before you can come back again. So it wouldn&rsquo;t
    be a quick trip either.
  </p>

  <p>
    Part of me felt dumb for not foreseeing an outcome like this, for
    not researching more or somehow getting us an earlier appointment
    or…something. And of course there is always the voice in my head
    reminding me how lucky I am, how many people have it so much
    harder than me in every way. And that&rsquo;s true of course. Unlike
    many immigrants, I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about Adam&rsquo;s safety upon
    returning to his home country&mdash;it&rsquo;s not like we were fleeing
    danger in the US. Plus, we had done long-distance for longer than
    3 months before anyway, for the semester early in our relationship
    when we both studied abroad, so it&rsquo;s not like it would break us up
    or anything. I trusted him completely, and we would be able to
    talk anytime over video chat too, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be like we
    couldn&rsquo;t stay in contact either.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even with all of that, I mostly just felt sad. And angry and a
    little desperate even. Rationally, I knew everything would be OK,
    but that didn&rsquo;t change the fact that this was not the plan, not
    what we wanted, and that <em>sucked</em>. I have been trying to
    just let myself acknowledge and feel the feelings I actually have
    recently, rather than trying to analyze them away. Because, as
    obvious as it sounds when I read this sentence, it can be hard to
    keep in mind that just because there are people suffering much
    more than me, doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m not allowed to be sad sometimes
    too. There was this voice in my head insisting it was such a
    &ldquo;First World Problem&rdquo; that I shouldn&rsquo;t be complaining about,
    even to myself, I should just shut up and be grateful. But as it
    says in Emily and Amelia Nagoski&rsquo;s wonderful book <cite>Burnout: The Secret to Unlocking The Stress Cycle,</cite>
    &ldquo;Being grateful for good things doesn&rsquo;t erase the difficult
    things&rdquo; (it really is a fantastic book, both well researched
    and easy to read, and I have been recommending it to everyone.)
    So, despite these pessimistic voices in my head, my optimistic
    tendency to look for the silver lining in every situation often
    cheers me up and keeps me going. At the same time though, it&rsquo;s
    absurd to expect to be cheerful at all times, and so I&rsquo;m trying my
    best to accept the cruddy-ness of the situation, to acknowledge
    that it was not what I wanted, and to move through those feelings
    without wallowing in them.
  </p>

  <p>
    So it was, that instead of attending the Fulbrighter
    &ldquo;Friendsgiving&rdquo; in Rostock on Saturday, I woke up at Maggie&rsquo;s
    apartment in Hamburg early enough to head to the airport with
    Adam. After his check-in counter finally opened, and we got all of
    his bags figured out, we said a quick airport &ldquo;Auf Wiedersehen&rdquo;
    (literally &ldquo;on seeing you again&rdquo; which I like better than goodbye,
    which feels rather final somehow) before he got in the security
    line.
  </p>

  <p>
    Luckily, spending the day with Maggie exploring Hamburg, which
    despite the number of times I had traveled through it, I had never
    done, was a great distraction. It was a pretty horrible day as far
    as the weather went (so, typical northern Germany…) but we didn&rsquo;t
    let that deter us. We set out for a walk along the harbor&mdash;cold
    rain or no! We strolled along, taking in the huge ships to our
    left, and the city skyline to our right. After walking through the
    famous Elster tunnel under the river Maggie finally admitted that
    her wet tennis shoes had made her toes completely numb, so she set
    off for some dry shoes and socks. Originally I though she could
    get some dry socks and shoes and meet me back out somewhere for
    lunch, but after buying some postcards and strolling about a bit
    more, getting wetter and colder myself, I decided to meet her back
    at her place for a leftovers lunch instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    The reheated curry was just as delicious as the night before, and
    it gave us the warmth and energy to head back out into the
    sogginess once again. We were both equally thrilled when the
    raindrops turned into the first snowflakes of the year&mdash;I
    don&rsquo;t think the first snow of the winter will ever not be exciting
    for me, I love the changing of the seasons! So it felt like a good
    time to visit the Christmas market near Maggie&rsquo;s apartment. It was
    much smaller and more compact than Rostock&rsquo;s market, set up as it
    was in the churchyard. We had to show our vaccine passes (or a
    negative test would have worked too) to get in, and we then got
    some Glühwein and hid from the rain (the snow had been sadly
    short-lived) in the crowded kids tent. I recognized and sang along
    with some of the carols from a German Christmas CD we had when I
    was a little kid too&mdash;a nice trip dow memory lane.
  </p>

  <p>
    After finishing our wine (you don&rsquo;t want to sip too slowly because
    cold Glühwein is a bit of an oxymoron) we headed for the other
    nearby market next to the U-bahn (subway) station. Upon arrival,
    we decided to get some food to warm ourselves up, and the
    Kartoffelpuffer which is the German version of potato pancakes,
    were delectable! The vendor gave me a funny look when I requested
    horseradish in addition to the more traditional sour cream, and
    instead of the normal applesauce, but it really satisfied my
    craving for something savory. Maggie got some hot chocolate I
    think, opting for her warmth and calories in liquid and more
    crucially chocolate form. We found a spot partway under a shelter
    but the drips occasionally made it right down my neck, and my
    right sleeve was getting quite wet. I can hear my mother&rsquo;s voice
    in my head pointing out the virtues of wool here, because my coat
    did indeed keep me pretty warm despite being wet. Nevertheless, we
    strolled around the small market and then headed out before too
    long.
  </p>

  <p>
    We made a quick pit-stop at a grocery store to pick up some snacks
    to take over to Mara&rsquo;s house later, where we had been invited for
    more Glühwein and a game night that evening. Mara is one of the
    teachers that Maggie works with at her school, and after becoming
    Maggie&rsquo;s running buddy, she kindly invited Maggie (and I got to
    tag along) over to her apartment&mdash;she is always eager to have
    game-night participants and to speak some English with native
    speakers. Thus armed with soft cheese and crusty bread, we headed
    back to Maggie&rsquo;s apartment to warm up before the walk to Mara&rsquo;s.
    We ended up watching a few episodes of &ldquo;New Girl&rdquo; since it is
    guaranteed to make me laugh and we had both already seen it and
    could therefore relax and not worry about the timing of finishing
    a movie before leaving.
  </p>

  <p>
    The walk to Mara&rsquo;s house wasn&rsquo;t long, and after some brief
    introductions, and more Glühwein it became clear that Mara is a
    kindred spirit. Her main flaw quickly revealed itself: namely that
    she doesn&rsquo;t really like cheese…but I did my best to overlook this
    as we got to know each other, snacked and chatted. It proved a bit
    complicated to understand the somewhat complex rules of
    &ldquo;Elfenland&rdquo; the board game she taught us how to play, especially
    after we were on to our second mug of Glühwein. We did eventually
    grasp the rules however, and had a fun time plotting a path across
    the mystical board. It was quite late when we eventually said our
    goodbyes with promises to do this again sometime.
  </p>

  <p>
    I headed back to Rostock the next day. Being the sweetheart that
    she is, fellow Rostock Fulbright English TA Karis met me at my
    house shortly after I got home and dropped off some scrumptious
    Thanksgiving leftovers, so I got a taste of the holiday this year
    after all. We had a lovely time drinking tea and chatting about
    politics and religion and crocheting. We decided to start up a
    weekly craft night with Amber (another Fulbrighter) too, since she
    is also an embroiderer and a recently obsessed knitter. One Karis
    headed out, my new adventure of living alone for the first time
    ever began&mdash;having always had roommates or family up to this point.
  </p>

  <p>
    And although this had not been the plan, I did my best to wrestle
    it into being an opportunity rather than just a bummer. As an
    introvert, I have no problem being alone, and other than listening
    to more music to fill up the quiet apartment, the transition
    hasn&rsquo;t been too difficult. I threw myself into lesson planning,
    and looked forward to our first craft night. I had been asked to
    talk to many classes about how I celebrate Christmas in the US, so
    I had a blast looking through old pictures I had pestered my aunt
    and uncle to send me, and putting together a slideshow of them to
    share. And of course, I needed my annual dose of Christmas movie
    watching, the usual steady stream of audiobooks, and I even began
    to knit some Christmas gnomes as little host gifts for all the
    people I would be visiting over the holidays&mdash;another fun
    thing to look forward to as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gabi also invited me over for some Christmas cookie baking, which
    was a nice activity for the third Sunday of advent. Before this
    year, I never would have referred to that Sunday as such, but it
    turns out the Germans are super into advent over here. Gabi, Frank
    and I discussed the secularization of Christmas in Germany while
    rolling out the dough. Whereas in the US &ldquo;Happy Holidays&rdquo; is the
    PC thing to wish someone in December whose religion or background
    are unknown, people here universally wish you a happy 1st, 2nd or
    3rd advent, as well as of course a &ldquo;Frohe Weinachten&rdquo; later in the
    month. The majority of Germans in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania are
    not registered with a christian church, with 81.8% identifying
    their affiliation as &ldquo;other or none&rdquo; according to Wikipedia, and
    so the celebration of the holiday has become quite separate from
    it&rsquo;s religious origins. During my Christmas presentations, several
    students told me that although their families are not at all
    Christian, they still look forward to Christmas as a time to
    celebrate being cozy, decorating the house, eating sweets, and
    spending time with friends and family, in addition to exchanging
    gifts.
  </p>

  <p>
    While the celebration of Christmas by families without a christian
    background isn&rsquo;t unheard of in the US either, the openness about
    it is somehow different. I explained how the practice of giving
    out chocolate to public schoolers on St. Nicholas day, and the
    advent wreaths that one teacher had brought in and set up in her
    classrooms probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed in the US, unless
    it was specifically presented in terms of &ldquo;this is a cultural
    tradition that <em>some people</em> celebrate form a certain
    culture we are studying.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s hard to articulate the difference.
    I mean it&rsquo;s not like everyone who celebrates Christmas in the US
    is a weekly church-goer either, far from it. But I always got the
    sense that there are enough people who actively do not celebrate
    the holiday that it is seen as somewhat rude to wish a group
    &ldquo;Merry Christmas&rdquo; unless you know for sure that everyone
    celebrates it. But there is a sense here that &rsquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter
    what you believe, you might as well eat some chocolate on December
    6th because, come on, who doesn&rsquo;t like chocolate? And we&rsquo;re in
    Germany, so that&rsquo;s what we do.&rsquo; This was exemplified in a story
    Maggie told me of someone in her German class explaining that they
    were Muslim and so didn&rsquo;t celebrate Christmas. The teacher
    blithely responded that &ldquo;Well you are in Germany now, so you get
      to have Christmas <em>too!</em>&rdquo; It somehow manages to feel
    welcoming and not at all like a passive-aggressive way to shove
    your religious beliefs down someone&rsquo;s throat, probably because the
    religious connection with Christmas is tenuous for so many
    Germans. From what I have seen in Rostock at least, it really has
    become a mostly secular holiday, more so than in the US. A case in
    point is the widespread celebration of advent, which I never heard
    discussed in the US outside of the church.
  </p>

  <p>
    After Frank lit all of the many candles spread around the living
    room, turned on all the Christmas lights (including both the
    indoor and outdoor red-and-green laser display on the ceiling) we
    ate some cake and fruit and drank some tea. I then got to help
    roll out the dough for Vanillekipferl, a traditional horn-shaped
    German Christmas cookie with ground almonds, vanilla and coated in
    powdered sugar. This was in addition to a unique recipe from
    Gabi&rsquo;s grandma which was a basic dough shaped like a mini pretzel
    and coated in white sugar. We listened to the &ldquo;Toten Hosen&rdquo;
    Christmas album while doing so, which is apparently an Uminski
    family tradition. Why not spice things up with a punk band&rsquo;s take
    on Christmas after all?
  </p>

  <p>
    We then watched the movie &ldquo;National Lampoon&rsquo;s Christmas Vacation&rdquo;
    which is another tradition that Gabi and Frank indulge in every
    year on the 3rd Sunday of advent. The movie itself was full of
    ridiculous and predictable slapstick humor, but it&rsquo;s hard not to
    enjoy watching something when your fellow viewers are as
    enthusiastic as they were&mdash;giggling and reciting the lines in
    German before the characters could get there in the English
    version we were watching. It is always funny to me which American
    movies become classics in other places, despite being nearly
    forgotten in their homeland.
  </p>

  <p>
    Frank drove me home with a tin full of cookies sometime after
    dark. I&rsquo;m not quite sure what time it was, but we had eaten some
    delicious soup after the movie and had some interesting
    discussions about wold politics and cultural differences, as was
    usual with them. After all, &ldquo;dark&rdquo; describes most hours in the day
    this time of year&mdash;anytime after 4pm and before 8:30am, being
    as far north as we are up here. It does become hard to keep track
    of the passing of time when you spend so many hours awake in the
    dark. It was a good thing it was closer to 4pm than 8:30 am when I
    got home though, because even though the presentation I would give
    to the 8th graders the next morning was one I had already given,
    so there was nothing to prepare, I would still have to be at
    school almost an hour before the sun, so I needed to sleep.
  </p>

  <p>
    The next week was sprinkled with presentations about
    Buche-Pattison American Christmas, or in the case of the 7th grade
    class I taught on Wednesday morning, UK vs. US Christmas
    traditions. That is the cool thing about having the luxury, so
    rare to most full-time teachers, of so much time to prepare
    lessons: I end up diving into the research and learning quite a
    bit myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was very convenient to be able to get my booster shot right at
    school on Tuesday afternoon too. After another teacher was kind
    enough to print out the paperwork I didn&rsquo;t know I needed to sign,
    I waited in line for the German soldier to check me in. It was
    interesting to see that about half the people in line still had
    their red vaccine booklets with the hammer and compass emblem of
    East Germany embossed on the front. They had gotten them after
    their childhood immunizations when they were born as East German
    citizens, and had never bothered to replace them after their
    country changed around them. In most ways, it&rsquo;s easy for me to
    forget that Germany wasn&rsquo;t always just Germany, and that I would
    have been in a completely different country only a few decades
    ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventually it was my turn and I went back to the classroom where a
    nurse gave me, because I am under 30, the Pfizer shot, or Biontech
    as it is know here by the German company&rsquo;s name. After waiting in
    another classroom for 15 minutes to see if there would be any
    allergic reactions, I was free to head home, with advice not to do
    any &ldquo;sport&rdquo; or drink any alcohol for the next 3 days. So I biked…slowly…home.
  </p>

  <p>
    On my way, I was able to stop off at the pharmacy and get the QR
    code I would need to upload to the CovPass app, and finally be
    able to easily flash that when entering restaurants, Christmas
    markets, and increasingly stores. This would be a great
    improvement, since I wouldn&rsquo;t have to explain that yes, the flimsy
    (and at this point rather ragged-looking) CDC vaccine card really
    was as official as it got in the USA. This is one of the instances
    where, despite being so un-digitized in terms of banks and
    governments offices, Germany seems to have actually leapfrogged
    past the US where (at least in August when I left) there was still
    no vaccine passport app widely in use that I knew of.
  </p>

  <p>
    Luckily, the only side effects from the booster that I woke up
    with the next day were a mildly sore arm, no worse than a
    flu-shot, and some tiredness. Though the tiredness could hardly
    even be blamed on the shot, and was much more likely to have
    stemmed from good, old-fashioned lack of sleep, since I had been
    up way too late finalizing that US vs. UK Christmas presentation,
    and then had to get up, get to school and teach half the lesson in
    complete darkness. Later that week the armpit of my vaccine arm
    did get a bit tender and swollen, but I never felt sick or
    anything, which was a relief. I was able to finish off the week
    strong then&mdash;relishing the inevitable buzzing &ldquo;it&rsquo;s almost
    Christmas break&rdquo; excitement palpable among both students and
    teachers. On Friday I brought my backpack packed for the weekend
    with me to school, and set off for Hamburg as a stopover before
    jetting off to Paris on another adventure with Maggie.
  </p>

  <p>
    So as you can see, it&rsquo;s not too hard to find the silver lining. I
    can easily convince myself that although Adam&rsquo;s visa debacle was
    stressful, unexpected and disappointing, I still <em>do</em> have
    so much to be thankful for. I am so lucky to be here for this year
    at all, and to have met so many amazing people here who are
    supporting me in lots of ways.Despite the pandemic, I have had
    such fantastic travel opportunities on top of everything else,
    thanks to the availability of both tests and vaccines here. Next
    stop, Paris!
