    Hello again, it's been a while! Here is a link to the photos from
    our Prague trip at last: <br/>

    I have finally figured out a way around the lack of a caption
    option on the google photos albums. I just made comments on the
    ones that needed some more context, so if you end up just looking
    at that, the story will hopefully be a bit more complete.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the short week, Adam met me and my full backpack at the
    Hauptbahnhof in Rostock on Friday afternoon (November 5th) and we
    boarded our train headed toward Prague. We were in a compartment
    again, this time with a family preparing for a weekend of hiking&mdash;it's
    always entertaining for me to try and figure out the stories of my
    fellow passengers, so when I wasn't listening to my audiobook, I
    eavesdropped a bit (hard not to when you are that close to people.) I
    think I concluded it was a dad, his two sons and another man who might
    be their uncle? Anyway, they disembarked just before we crossed the
    Czech boarder, just after Dresden, whose Hauptbahnhof sported a
    gigantic Christmas tree, though it was barely November. We eventually
    made it to Prague, and navigated our way to the hostel where we met up
    with Laura once again. We checked into the hostel and settled into our
    bunks for an early(ish) night.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was very interesting to notice the drastically different pace
    compared to our Zell trip with Maggie, which was characterized by
    rising early in order to fit as much in as possible each day. Laura
    has never really been such a morning person, which I had sort of
    forgotten since college. This encouraged Adam and my late-sleeping
    inclinations as well, so it was after 10 by the time we left the
    hostel the next morning. We decided we wanted to explore the famous
    Charles Bridge, and Prague Castle for the day, so we made moves in
    that direction to explore breakfast options.
  </p>

  <p>
    This turned out not to be the wisest move, since that area was much
    more crowded with tourists, and therefore more expensive too. Compared
    with Copenhagen prices however, (where Laura had just been) it still
    wasn't bad, and after some wandering about, we found a place that had
    lots of options and was relatively empty. Just before ordering, a guy
    Laura knew from our hostel wandered in as well, so he joined us at our
    table. Mack is from Cape Cod, and had quit his job to do some
    traveling for a while, and was very nice. It's always funny to me how
    we probably never would have met or had any reason to interact if we <em>had</em> met
    in the states, but somehow meeting someone from your own country while
    abroad draws you together. Since he had essentially the same plan for
    the day as we did, we ended up sticking together after breakfast (not
    as good as the cafe in Copenhagen, but filling and pretty tasty.)
  </p>

  <p>
    Charles Bridge was interesting&mdash;full of statues and beautiful views of
    the Moldau River, glittering on the wonderfully sunny day. It was also
    (due to being a beautiful sunny Saturday) FULL of people which,
    especially after so many months of avoiding crowds was a bit
    overwhelming, so we didn't linger so long as we might otherwise have.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once on the other side of the river, we began to wind our way up the
    hill towards Prague castle. Once we made it to the first lookout
    point, we were surprised (but then again, not that surprised) to find
    a Starbucks&mdash;pushing, yep you guessed it: pumpkin spice lattes. Adam
    and Mack gave in to the basic white girl lurking in their heart of
    hearts, and ordered the syrupy orange "coffee" while Laura and I
    visited the bathroom. Although I have now seen Starbucks in countries
    all over the world, I would venture to guess that very few on them
    contain spiral staircases. This one did however. The juxtaposition
    between how uniform and American the store itself was (aside from also
    selling Czech pilsners) and then the fact that it was feet away from a
    centuries old castle compound was pretty funny to us. After enjoying
    the pumpkin-adorned view from the Starbucks terrace, we headed up to
    the castle. We passed a very interesting…altar? Display? Celebrating
    the defeat of the communist party in the recent Czech elections,
    featuring, in addition to candles and fake flowers, what appeared to
    be an actual severed pig's head, just casually hanging out on the edge
    of the square. It's just not something you see everyday I guess!
  </p>

  <p>
    We didn't actually end up going inside the castle itself, but we went
    inside the walls and saw into the stunning cathedral, with all of the
    impressive stained class windows soaring to the gorgeous vaulted
    ceilings that one comes to expect of medieval European churches. Laura
    and I ventured up (and up and up and up) the spiral staircase to the
    lookout. It was well worth the climb to get a view of the city on such
    a lovely clear day.
  </p>

  <p>
    After descending the tower and the hill, it was time for a snack for
    Laura, since she had gotten filled up on her gigantic latte before
    eating any breakfast, and I had had to finish a lot of her food. After
    getting one of those spiral cut fried potatoes on a stick, she was
    satisfied, and we headed back to the hostel to chill a bit. We began
    to suspect that Mack and his friend Alex were following us when they
    walked into the Vietnamese restaurant where we were eating dinner…or
    maybe it was that it was just really near the hostel.
  </p>

  <p>
    We had a couple beers at the hostel before setting off for the club
    with a bunch of the other hostel guests. At the subway station, as we
    were all chatting, it came to light that one of the kids, in addition
    to graduating high school with Adam's sister, Mack's friend Alex had
    also worked as the official photographer and taken his picture at the
    graduation at his college the year before&mdash;a small world moment, to be
    sure!
  </p>

  <p>
    We felt able to relax at the club, since they checked vaccine cards at
    the door, so we had a wonderful time dancing the night away. We formed
    a fun little hostel dance circle and boogied away the hours. After
    walking home at nearly 4 am, we collapsed into bed after making sure
    to drink enough water that our future selves wouldn't be in too much
    pain. I didn't actually get out of bed till after 11 the next morning,
    and when I checked my phone, all those tiny swaying dance steps, and
    the trek back to the hostel after midnight had added up to 16,047
    steps before I even got out of bed for the day!
  </p>

  <p>
    We eventually did manage, however, to drag ourselves out of bed.
    Thanks to all that water right before finally going to sleep, none of
    us felt too bad either. After stumbling through the grocery store
    without speaking a word of Czech, we managed to get the pastries we
    wanted, and had a lovely pastry breakfast (brunch? lunch?) on a bench
    outside the church that was right near the hostel.
  </P>

  </figure>

  <p>
    Given the time of day, and how light our pastry breakfast had been, we
    decided to move on to lunch right away. We found a nice Pho place and
    had some delicious Vietnamese soup to warm us up after the walk there.
    We lingered over our meal, and enjoyed rehashing the night before as
    well as strolling down memory lane. The result was that there wasn't
    much daylight left to us when we finally strolled out of the
    restaurant. I wanted to go see the botanical gardens however, so we
    headed in that direction.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sun was in the process of setting by the time we arrived at the
    gardens, but dusk is as good a time as any to smell roses, and we
    meandered our way through the terraced pathways and enjoyed the
    changing leaves as well as the flowers and even rocks they featured. I
    had read the information online incorrectly, so unfortunately the
    indoor greenhouse closed earlier than we thought on Sunday, so we
    didn't get to go inside that, but it felt nice to stroll around and
    get some fresh air nevertheless.
  </p>

  <p>
    After some more strolling through the city, we were ready for another
    meal, so we made our way to a traditional Czech restaurant we had
    heard was good. We enjoyed the classically good pilsner in the
    adorably squat glass mugs with big curved handles. Adam was very
    impressed by the beer "scorecard" as he called it, where the waiters
    checked off which beers our table had ordered. We did not "win"
    however, since we were very far from checking off all the mugs on the
    sheet. Our hardy meals showed up and we all tucked in happily. I was
    thrilled to be able to order a giant chunk of fried cheese with
    buttered potatoes as my entree, Laura gave Schnitzel another chance
    after her disappointing experience with it in Rostock, and Adam
    had…pork chops? Some kind of meat thing anyway&mdash;I was just happy to
    share some of the sauerkraut that came with it. Another delicious
    meal, and it felt like a very appropriate thing to do in
    Prague&mdash;perhaps the most "authentic to the place" meal we had yet
    eaten on our travels, and a good way to round off our last evening in
    the Czech Republic.
  </p>

  </figure>

  <p>
    We went to bed early enough to be able to get up in the morning and
    see one more sight before our train left just after noon. Laura hadn't
    gotten much sleep the night before, since her bunkmate had been
    coughing a lot in the night…(the girl assured the hostel she had
    gotten a negative Covid test…) so Laura decided to sleep in. Adam
    and I headed for Vyšehrad&mdash;a castle compound which, I must say did a
    great job of being impenetrable, and I guess that <em>was</em> probably
    its defensive goal. It was quite frustrating to navigate however,
    since we were not in fact an invading army but rather some rushed
    tourists with limited time before our train took off. We made it up
    the hill and inside the castle walls, but google maps <em>really</em> led
    us astray when it came to actually finding the churches we were
    seeking, so unfortunately we had to give up and turn back before we
    figured out which level we were supposed to be on to get where we
    wanted to go. There was a a good lookout cover the city and some
    lovely yellow leaves though, so it wasn't a total bust. Also just
    being inside castle walls is already pretty exciting, honestly, even
    if Rostock's own city wall had numbed me to that wonder a bit.
  </p>

  <p>
    We made it back to the hostel for final check-out and to pick up our
    bags and exchange some photos and hugs with Laura before rushing off
    to the train station. Once again, google maps was not on our side as
    it led us down a very pedestrian unfriendly route which left us on the
    wrong side of a very busy street with no crosswalk…We did at last
    make it to the station, and heaved ourselves, panting, onto the train
    just before it pulled out. The ride back was uneventful, other than
    the rainbow we saw arching through the gray skies&mdash;the kid in me is
    always thrilled to see a rainbow. They are just rare enough to feel
    like magic, every time, and I hope that is a wonder I never will
    become numb to.
  </p>

  <p>
    We grabbed some hummus and bread for dinner in the Berlin
    Hauptbahnhof, and ate on the platform. The Berlin-Rostock train was
    unfortunately <em>not</em> an express and let me tell you, I had no
    idea there were quite so many little towns between here and there, and
    although I'm sure they are all very charming, I was really ready to be
    home already, since it felt like we had been traveling for days rather
    than hours somehow. The worst bit though, was waiting the half hour
    for the tram that then spit us out just in time to wait another chilly
    20 minutes for the bus that would finally take us home sweet home.
  </p>

  <p>
    We had some worried moments when we found out a few days later
    that we had been exposed to Covid in Prague, but luckily Adam and
    I both tested negative and neither of us had any symptoms. I am
    happy to say I got my booster shot on December 14th as well, so
    while I will of course continue to be careful, it's nice to know I
    have renewed my protection as well.

          represent Fulbright Germany in any way. Whew, now that the
          official bit is over, let's dig in!
