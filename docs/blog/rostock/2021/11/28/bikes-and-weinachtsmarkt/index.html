  <p>
    Hello all, it&rsquo;s been busy! Here at last are the photos:
    <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/VigNUQEa197ft9zY8">https://photos.app.goo.gl/VigNUQEa197ft9zY8</a>
    once again, see my comments on the google photo album for context
    and further musings on the pictures.
  </p>

  <p>
    The two weeks after getting back from Prague were mostly
    uneventful, besides the relief at getting negative covid test
    results for Adam and I after our exposure in Prague. I began
    giving presentations about Thanksgiving at school too, which was
    fun. I made sure to be honest about the more brutal history of the
    holiday, since the students are old enough to not get the
    sugar-coated &ldquo;rainbows and unicorns and everyone lived happily
    ever after&rdquo; version of the story.
  </p>

  <p>
    I see my role as a Fulbrighter here as part ambassador, wanting to
    present a positive face of the country I come from, but the other
    part of my job is to be honest in this communication so that the
    connections I can build here can be stronger. I also really
    believe that facing the uglier parts of our history head-on is the
    only way to move forward without repeating that ugliness, and
    frankly the way that most Germans seem to seriously consider and
    recon with the history of Naziism is inspiring for that reason.
    Therefore, I thought it was important to explain that Thanksgiving
    is tied up with genocide, forced assimilation and repeated land
    theft…but it was also nice to share the more positive aspects we
    celebrate today, like gratefulness, togetherness with friends and
    family and of course delicious food. Thanksgiving is one of the
    few uniquely American holidays, since most of the things we
    celebrate originated in other continents, so I gave a similar
    presentation about my family&rsquo;s traditions to several classes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Adam&rsquo;s birthday came at the end of the third week in November, but
    after me pestering him repeatedly about what he wanted to eat and
    do to celebrate, he responded that all he wanted for his birthday
    was for me to stop asking questions about it, so it ended up being
    a pretty normal day. Maggie arrived for her first visit to Rostock
    the next day however, so that was a nice change to routine.
  </p>

  <p>
    We met her at the Hauptbahnhof later in the morning than we would
    have liked (being the sleepyheads we are) so we could go straight
    to Warnemünde, to see the Baltic. We had a nice time walking out
    to the lighthouse and along the beach walkway. Once we determined
    that the old lighthouse was closed for the season, so we couldn&rsquo;t
    go up and look out, we eventually grabbed some fish sandwiches
    (for the fish eaters) and fries for me, to munch on while we
    strolled.
  </p>

  <p>
    We watched the seagulls looping through the gusts overhead, noting
    how many fewer people there were compared to the warm September
    day when we had last visited&mdash;it made sense considering how little
    the biting November wind encouraged swimming, even for Maggie and
    I who liked to brave the cold. She was about halfway done eating
    her sandwich when the swarm of sea gulls decided they wanted to
    share, and swooped down and snatched it from Maggie&rsquo;s hand! They
    even took a little slice of her finger skin with them&mdash;those beaks
    and claws are as sharp as they look I guess! I mean I have heard
    of gulls snatching things out of people&rsquo;s hands, but had never
    seen it, and it was quite startling up close I must say. Luckily,
    Maggie is perpetually over prepared (or in this case,
    appropriately prepared, I suppose) so she had Neosporin and a
    band-aid in her backpack, and was able to bandage herself up.

  <p>
    We headed home after a bit more strolling, sculpture-gazing and
    coffee for Adam. We enjoyed a brief backyard fire and then went to
    bed fairly early, since there were big biking plans afoot for the
    next day, which looked like it would be somewhat less than totally
    rainy. You learn to look upon this kind of weather forecast as
    pretty good after living in Germany for a while. Adam wanted to
    take it easy, and since Maggie hadn&rsquo;t been able to take her bike
    on the train, we lowered the seat on Adam&rsquo;s borrowed bike for her
    to borrow, so the two of us could set out on our adventure early
    the next morning.
  </p>

  <p>
    After running back into the already locked house before the sun
    was all the way up, thinking I had just forgotten a mask, it
    turned out I had also forgotten my phone, so it&rsquo;s good I went
    back! Our adventure was off to a better start after that&mdash;Maggie
    and I followed my normal bike route along the river to school,
    except we continued across the water to the Hauptbahnhof. There,
    we got on a train bound for Graal-Müritz, a little town on the
    coast to the northeast, where we would continue biking along the
    water. We were happy to have stayed dry thus far, and to have made
    our train, so we set off in good spirits.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was just after 9 when we found our first gorgeous beach of the
    day, and about half an hour later, in another little town farther
    up the coast called Dierhagen, I slowed down to examine what I
    thought were some oddly shaped gray…sheep? wandering along the
    tree-line at the edge of a field. We went to investigate. It
    quickly became clear that they were not sheep…or goats, and were
    the wrong color (but about the right size it seemed like) to be
    deer. As we watched the curious creatures for a moment longer, and
    struggled through the brambles to get a better look, we heard an
    odd warbling cry coming from the…herd? or was it flock? They did
    seem to be walking in a rather jerky bird-like fashion, but they
    were huge and seemed to be wandering freely, not belonging to any
    of the nearby farms. We weren&rsquo;t sure if ostriches or emus were
    native to northern Europe…upon consultation with Maggie&rsquo;s
    ornithologist friend we THINK they may be greater Rhea birds, even
    though the calls we were hearing didn&rsquo;t exactly match. So it
    remains somewhat of a mystery, and was certainly an interesting
    investigation along the way.

  <p>
    After passing through Dierhagen, we headed for Wustrow, which was
    an interesting ride along a strip of land between the Baltic on
    our left and a little bay on our right. Upon arrival in Wustrow,
    we enjoyed the boardwalk from the beach that extended out into the
    water and provided a nice view of the waves from behind as they
    crashed onto shore. From there we turned back, noting the
    astonishing amount of thatched roofs on the houses we passed. We
    eventually found a sunny and dry bus stop and ate our first of two
    brie and homemade raspberry jam (thanks Gabi!) sandwiches before
    turning and heading east along the bay toward Ribnitz-Damgarten.
  </p>

    </a>

    <figcaption>Being such a midwesterner, I am still thrilled every time I&rsquo;m by saltwater</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Once in Ribnitz-Damgarten, we locked up our bikes and set off for
    a stroll into town. We noted the lovely church, a small Christmas
    market, and the &ldquo;Rostocker Tor&rdquo; which we had to take a look at. It
    was a regular stone towner pretty much, but funny that it was
    named after a city we were no longer in. We found a nice park
    behind the old cloister to enjoy our second sandwiches and some
    apples and chocolate&mdash;much deserved after the 20 miles we had
    already biked that day.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had been looking for some fresh sage in order to make the
    delicious sweet potato gnocchi recipe I was craving, but my
    searching in the nearby grocery stores for about a week had been
    fruitless. I was thinking about this as we strolled down the
    street in this little town, so you can imagine my surprise when we
    suddenly came across a patch of sage growing right there on the
    street! What are the odds? I took the opportunity to fill up my
    then empty sandwich container, so we could have some for dinner
    that night.
  </p>

  <p>
    After determining that taking the train back to Rostock from there
    directly, rather than cycling back to Graal-Müritz, like we had
    planned wouldn&rsquo;t work, we hopped on the bikes again and headed
    back by pedal power. A rainbow saw us on our way&mdash;peeking at us
    from between the clouds on the other side of the bay.
  </p>

  <p>
    The way back didn&rsquo;t include any mystery birds or sandwich or
    boardwalk stops, so it went more quickly, and we made it back to
    the station where we had started biking with plenty of time to get
    tickets and board the train before it really started raining. We
    congratulated ourselves on our excellent weather timing and
    exchanged pictures on the way back. The rain didn&rsquo;t let up by the
    time we arrived back at the Rostock Hauptbahnhof, so it was a
    soggy and windy ride back around the river to Gehlsdorf, but it
    was ok, because we could stumble inside and peel off our wet
    clothes and get warm showers before too long.
  </p>

  <p>
    The gnocchi recipe is quite labor-intensive, so it was a good
    thing Adam had pre-baked the sweet potatoes before we got back.
    Maggie and I proved to be good cooking as well as adventure
    buddies though, so we had a nice time chatting and chopping, till
    the buttery sage-y goodness was ready to eat. They didn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> live
    up to the delicious memories I had of the last time I had made the
    recipe, but they were still pretty tasty. It was another early-ish
    night, since our ride had totaled 40 miles so we were pretty worn
    out. Adam did get Maggie to try his new favorite digestive:
    Underburg before bedtime though. She was not as opposed to the
    vaguely licorice flavor as I had become, but wasn&rsquo;t nearly as much
    a fan as Adam either.
  </p>

  <p>
    the next day, after Maggie&rsquo;s virtual German class, and my
    in-person class at school, we were able to explore the Rostock
    Weinachtsmarkt on the very first day it was open, before Maggie
    had to hop on her train back to Hamburg. For the uninitiated: A
    Weinachtsmarkt is a German traditional Christmas market. Most
    German towns will open a little market similar to the farmers
    markets usually held in the same place, but these are only open
    from late November to about the 22 of December, and they are
    explicitly Christmas themed. You can get Glühwein (hot mulled
    wine) sugar-roasted nuts, and many other delicious snack and meal
    options in various stands. There are also stalls selling
    traditional wooden ornaments and decorations, in addition to
    advent wreaths.
  </p>

  <p>
    If felt a bit odd to be starting the Christmas season so early,
    but when you don&rsquo;t have Thanksgiving to look forward to, and each
    day is getting a bit darker, you have to introduce some cheer into
    the equation somehow! Rostock claimed to have the biggest
    Christmas market in the north, which might actually be true, since
    Hamburg had many smaller ones throughout the city, whereas Rostock
    went with the strategy of just turning the entire downtown into a
    market, essentially.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was interesting this year, being the first year that the
    markets had been open since the pandemic. Since Rostock&rsquo;s market
    was so extensive, they couldn&rsquo;t possibly fence or enclose the
    entire thing, so they just required you to either show a vaccine
    card (most people here have them turned into QR codes on their
    phones) or else a recent negative rapid test, and then you would
    get a wristband that you needed in order to buy anything from the
    stands. And masks were required. They were doing their best, but
    it doesn&rsquo;t really work to sell people hot food and drink and then
    tell them to wear masks…Not to mention the fact that the market
    had just taken over the normal shopping street meant that there
    were certainly people (not necessarily vaccinated or tested)
    walking through as well. It was rather crowded, but at least it
    was also outside, which does help.

  </figure>

  <p>
    We were able to slurp some Glühwein, crunch on some nuts and
    stroll around taking in the ferris wheel, lights and music for a
    while before Maggie had to head for her train. Adam and I headed
    home before too long, since we would be back the next morning for
    the residence permit appointment we would have at the migration
    office.
