  <h1>Fulbright Origin Story: "I Know What I Know"</h1>
  <time datetime="2021-09-18" class="italic">September 18, 2021</time>

  <p>
    It all started way back in the misty past of the summer of 2020. I was
    discussing career goals and the desire to eventually relocate, with my
    dear cousin and Fulbright alumna Hannah. She listened patiently to me
    as I talked about wanting to travel and about liking the work I was
    doing at the Spanish immersion elementary school where I was working,
    but not being ready to commit to a masters in education yet. She
    suggested I apply for an English teaching assistantship (ETA) in
    Germany, like she had in Russia, through Fulbright. Given that I
    already spoke German, and there are more ETA positions available in
    Germany than in a lot of other countries, it seemed like it was worth
    a shot, even though the program is still incredibly competitive. It
    was the right idea at the right moment: the spark was ignited.
  </p>

  <p>
    The initial application was due in October of 2020, and after many
    many drafts (edited by the amazing Fulbright team at Earlham) and
    generous recommendations submitted by my former boss and professors I
    turned it in on time. Thus began the first interminable waiting
    period—I wouldn't hear anything until January.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was relieved to get the email on the very last business day of
    January, saying that I had been selected as a semi-finalist. Yay!
    But it meant the second interminable waiting period had begun. It
    was certainly good news, but I wasn't in yet. I was told I would
    get my next decision letter sometime between March and June—quite
    a wide range of time!
  </p>

  <p>
    It was in mid-April that I found out that I had been wait-listed.
    Some more weird news: I was disappointed to not have been selected
    out right, but I still wasn't completely out of the running yet. I
    would hear back from Fulbright again only IF I was accepted,
    otherwise I should presumably move on with my life. In the
    meantime: more waiting.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was during this period that I was listening to one of my
    favorite albums, <cite>Graceland</cite> by Paul Simon, and a line
    in the song "I Know What I Know" began to elicit a small growl
    from me every time I heard it:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Aren't you the woman who was recently given a Fulbright?
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It was taunting me: I wasn't that woman. Ugg. As the weeks went on
    I lost more and more hope of getting the grant, and began applying
    for other jobs. I had been preparing for a change for so long that
    it seemed unbearable to settle back into my previous routine as if
    nothing had happened.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had finished the school year in Indianapolis on a bittersweet
    note: not knowing if it would be my last day there or not. I hoped
    it would be while also knowing how much I would miss my wonderful
    coworkers and students if it were.
  </p>

  <p>
    It wasn't until the last week of June, when I had already applied
    to several jobs and was getting annoyed at the seemingly endless
    waiting involved in THAT process that I heard from Fulbright. I
    had so completely accepted that I wouldn't be going to Germany
    that I just burst out laughing when I woke up to the email. I
    didn't even have to open it to know what it meant, I just had to
    begin mentally reshuffling what the next year would look like.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of triggering yet more waiting, this news triggered a
    flurry of activity. There were flights and storage units and
    clothing sorting and furniture sales and Fulbright paperwork and
    TESOL courses to do. Not to mention all the things I had already
    planned before everything changed, and stressing over all the
    unknowns, like where exactly I would be placed, which I didn't
    find out until a few weeks later.
  </p>

  <p>
    Long story short, it has taken me almost a year to get to this
    point: sitting in my living room in Gehlsdorf, a quiet residential
    neighborhood north of the Warnow River in Rostock Germany, still
    listening to Graceland. I still only know what I know. But it
    turns out I actually AM the woman who was recently given a
    Fulbright! I hope you enjoy reading (or skipping to the pictures,
    that's fine too!) as what I know encompasses more and more
    insights on living and working on the baltic coast of Germany.
