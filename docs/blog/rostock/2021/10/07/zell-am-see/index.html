    This is a link to the most photos yet, and believe it or not,
    there were tons more I didn't even include:

    It wasn't long after returning from Copenhagen that we began
    planning for another trip. Before we set out on our fall break
    adventures, we had some important appointments in the last week of
    September. Firstly, we had to officially register our address as
    citizens of Rostock, which went smoothly, thanks to the help of
    one of the English teachers, Ireen. More excitingly for me,
    officially being a citizen of Rostock allowed me to go get my
    library card&mdash;the only official status I <em>really</em> needed,
    after all. This also meant that I could finally set up a German
    bank account through which I will eventually be paid.
    Hopefully…someday…some bureaucracy and miscommunication means
    I haven't actually gotten paid yet, but I have faith it will
    happen soon.
  </p>

    <figcaption>I was as thrilled to be a member of the library behind me as I look</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Adam was recovering from a little cold he had picked up in
    Copenhagen (and yes, it was just a cold&mdash;we got him tested just to
    be safe. It turns out masks protect you from more than just
    COVID!) so we didn't head for Hamburg till Saturday. By then he
    was feeling much better, and we boarded the train for the first
    leg of the long journey south to Austria.
  </p>

  <p>
    We were headed to Maggie's house&mdash;another Fulbrighter who happens
    to be friends with my cousin Ian, and a big hiker and general
    adventure-seeker. Who better to plan a trip to the Alps with? We
    were anticipating a nice afternoon of exploring Hamburg before
    getting to bed early so we could wake up at 3:30 the next morning,
    in order to walk back to the train station and be on board our <em>early</em> morning
    express train towards Zell am See, our final alpine destination.
    But alas, things did not go as planned.
  </p>

  <p>
    Adam and I were half an hour from Lübeck, which is about halfway
    to Hamburg, when there was an announcement that there had been an
    accident on the tracks ahead (I think I heard something about
    animals on the tracks?) the train couldn't go onwards and we all
    had to get off. We were in Herrnburg, which I overheard a fellow
    passenger call "irgendwo im niergendwo" which is the German
    equivalent of the middle of nowhere. We were told there would be a
    special bus coming to take us the rest of the way to Lübeck, or
    else we could take the regular city bus. So we followed the herd
    toward the bus stop, dubious as to how an entire trainload of
    people would fit onto a single bus…
  </p>

        alt="Train to bus kerfuffle"
      />
    </a>

    <figcaption>So many passengers, and no transportation</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    It turned out we didn't need to answer that question for quite a
    while, since it was nearly an hour before a bus of any kind showed
    up. In the meantime we looked up what a taxi to Lübeck
    Hauptbahnhof (and our next train connection to Hamburg) would be,
    but when we discovered it would cost more than the entire train
    ride from Rostock to Hamburg, we just couldn't do it. So we sat
    back to wait with everyone else. There were kids running around
    playing tag, people breaking out the snacks, and someone even had
    some speakers, which provoked a mini dance party, so it wasn't all
    bad.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventually a city bus came, and since there had been no sign of
    our promised special bus, we all pretty much decided to go for it
    and cram ourselves onto the (mercifully empty) bus. The dance
    partiers and the families with strollers decided they would wait
    it out, after there were already nearly 100 of us jammed into the
    double length bus.
  </p>

  <p>
    At one point during the ride I was standing on one foot, with my
    backpack under me, wedged between Adam and the seat next to me,
    trying not to fall over… I always find it interesting how social
    rules bend in those kinds of situations. Normally, Germans are not
    the type to strike up conversations with strangers on public
    transportation, but all of that pretty much goes out the window
    when you are "packed in cheek-to-jowl" as my grandma would
    put it. The driver announced that we all had to have valid train
    tickets to Lübeck, and there was a chorus of "Yep, we have them!"
    echoing through the bus. The woman next to me just rolled her eyes
    and said "What, is he going to <em>check</em>?" which did
    make me laugh&mdash;we could all barely manage to turn around; so
    the idea of anyone trying to walk the length of the bus checking
    tickets really was comical, and would probably have started a
    minor revolt if it had been attempted.
  </p>

  <p>
    The driver promised us he wouldn't be doing his normal route,
    since no one else could fit on the bus anyway. But somehow wasn't
    what happened, and we did indeed pull over every block or so only
    to open the doors to some shocked commuters asking "What's going <em>on</em>?"
    A few brave souls did try to push their way aboard, which caused a
    fair bit of grumbling (at some point there really is just no more
    room.) We eventually made it to Lübeck Hauptbahnhof (having been
    instructed to get off and get on a slightly less packed bus at a
    certain point) where we were able to catch the next train to
    Hamburg without any more issues.
  </p>

  <p>
    After navigating to her apartment in an already dark Hamburg, we
    had a low-key dinner at a Thai place in Maggie's neighborhood. We
    got to know each other a bit, discussing favorite books and
    figuring out how she had met Ian (the climbing gym, where else?)
    before heading to bed. Or "heading to floor" in our case&mdash;Adam
    was gallant enough to let me sleep on her one sleeping pad.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we woke up it could hardly be called morning, but we dragged
    ourselves and our minimal luggage to the station. We arrived at
    the Hauptbahnhof well before the sun, in plenty of time to grab
    some breakfast sandwiches and board the train. We attempted to go
    back to sleep, at least until the sun rose. We had a quick
    transfer in Nürnberg, then a slightly longer one in Munich, where
    I naturally had to buy the pretzel that was bigger than my head <em>and</em> the
    smaller one covered in cheese. I am sad to say that my
    north-German pretzels experiences have thus far been sadly lacking
    compared to their southern counterparts. Thus replenished, we
    continued our journey southward, where we crossed into Austria in
    the early afternoon. We changed trains one more time in Wörgle,
    where we quickly became overwhelmed as we gaped at the stunning
    alpine vistas that sped by the train windows.
  </p>

  <p>
    Zell am See really knows how to impress right off the bat, since
    you walk out of the main train station straight towards this view:
  </p>

      />
    </a>

    <figcaption>It felt like stepping into paradise</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    We were lucky enough to have the full compliment of sunshine to
    fully display the splendor of the lake and mountains in the
    background.
  </p>

  <p>
    After walking uphill (we would end up doing a lot of that!) to our
    airbnb, and getting a quick tour, we dropped our bags and Adam and
    I relaxed a bit while Maggie went for her daily run. When she
    returned, we retraced some of her steps and found a nice little
    beach where Maggie and I went for a swim. I splashed in quickly so
    no one would notice that I din't exactly have on a proper swimming
    suit… It was quite shallow, and not as cold as expected,
    considering it is fed by mountain streams that I can only assume
    are partly fed by snowmelt themselves. Also it was already
    October. But since we both grew up in the Great Lakes region, our
    cold water tolerance is quite high. Since we couldn't convince him
    to join us, Adam was our on-shore documentarian. Despite the
    chill, it was a gloriously refreshing experience: watching the
    occasional sailboat drift by, and spinning around and around,
    marveling at the mountains on all sides, as the sun sank lower in
    the sky.
  </p>

  <p>
    After drying off and changing back into dry clothes, we strolled a
    bit more before stopping at an Italian restaurant for some pizza,
    pasta and risotto. A lengthy debate ensued over dinner about the
    merits of spoons vs forks vs chop-sticks, and the appropriate
    use-cases of each. It got rather heated at times.
  </p>

  <p>
    After finishing our food, we went in search of a grocery store for
    some hiking snacks for the next day. The only store open on a
    Sunday evening was a little Middle-Eastern grocery, where we
    picked up some humus and pitas and apples. We then went back to
    the apartment to plan which hike we would do. Maggie's thirst for
    hiking adventure really led this charge, especially since she had
    all the relevant trail-searching apps. We talked her out of the 20
    mile hike, since Adam and my fitness levels where nowhere near
    hers, and we eventually settled on a 12 mile route before heading
    to bed.
  </p>

  <p>
    We were up and on the first bus from Zell am See to neighboring
    Kaprun by 7 the next morning. We saw the sun rise on a slightly
    cloudy (but not rainy!) day from the bus. Next stop was the
    grocery store for some more snacks. We got some sturdy seed-filled
    bread, cherry tomatoes in a squish-resistant carton, "Bergkäse"
    (we had to buy the mountain cheese for our mountain adventure,)
    some trail mix (which is called "Studenten Fütter" in German,
    meaning "student feed") and of course, lastly and most
    importantly: 3 kinds of chocolate. We also grabbed some morning
    pastries at the bakery and then set off on the extensive uphill
    walk to get to the trailhead where our actual hike would begin. I
    had 10,000 steps before 10 am that day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maggie quickly sped ahead of Adam and I, as we puffed laboriously
    up the mountain. I used the stunning scenery and scraggly flowers
    and mushrooms as excuses to stop and take pictures extremely
    frequently (but really I just had to catch my breath.) The
    consequence was that I ended up with multiple hundreds of pictures
    to document the hike. After a particularly loud groan as I stood
    up from taking a picture, Adam did eventually suggest that
    repeatedly doing squats in order to frame my favorite kind of
    shots (flower in the foreground, view in the background) was
    actually probably <em>not</em> helping me rest my legs
    effectively. He had a point, but it was hard to resist the
    brightly colored alpine flowers and the endless supply of "Schöne
    Blick(s)" (beautiful views) that surrounded us at every turn.

      "Please, Not So Fast!" is what my legs were screaming at me.

  <p>
    The colors alone were stunning. The low reddish bushes that turned
    out to be blueberries, the browns and greens of the grasses, the
    variegated green of the pines blending their way up the
    neighboring mountain, the distant blues and grays, with caps of
    white on the far-off peaks, and the occasional bright yellow,
    orange, purple or pink of the little flowers that forged their way
    in that harsh landscape made each aching step worth it. We
    followed the red, white, red patches of paint striped on trees and
    then rocks as the trees fell away, imagining what it must have
    been like to lug paint cans and brushes all that way up the
    mountain in order to paint the Austrian flag like a beacon of the
    trail to follow. My mind was really blown when I finally struggled
    my way to a ridge-top and gasped "What?" in sheer awe of the
    glacier that had just come into view. Then I looked down and saw
    that the muddy ground had been churned up by a herd's worth of <em>hoof prints</em>!
    If I could barely drag myself and my tiny backpack up here, how
    had an entire herd of cows done it?! It really started to make
    sense why all the marketing on everything from yogurt to
    milk-chocolate made such a big deal about the <em>alpine</em> milk
    contained in the product: these are some very accomplished cows!

      I had to photograph the astonishing fact that even the bird poop
      was pretty up there! All those blueberries meant it matched my
      shoe.

  <p>
    After a ton of breaks and even more photos, we finally made it to
    the summit! We rewarded ourselves with a feast of the provisions
    we had lugged up there. Not necessarily all together, though there
    were some inventive combinations. Anything tastes delicious when
    you've worked hard to drag it to 8,104 ft of elevation, especially
    when you're enjoying it while marveling at the stunning view. I
    might even be tempted to try Bergkäse and Nutella at sea-level
    though, it was surprisingly tasty.

    <p>
      We took some much deserved rest, food, water and the obligatory
      pictures. Then, the one fellow hiker we had seen (not counting
      the austere farmer/herder we passed early on, smoking as he
      stalked past us, carrying an impressively large spiked stick)
      showed us how to open the tiny door in the side of the metal
      cross that stood on the peak, and extract the little book to add
      our names to the record of those who had made it to the top.
      Given how long it had taken us to get that far, and how much
      daylight remained, we decided to forgo the other peaks we had
      planned to summit, and begin the descent.

        The pictures never quite do scenery like this justice. Which I
        guess is exactly why people climb mountains!
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The first bit wasn't bad, as we were able to chat (Adam and I
      could finally keep up with Maggie) so we swapped stories we had
      read/heard about of gruesome wilderness disasters and rescues.
      After a rest and recalculation, once we got among the trees
      again, we decided we should take another "bail-out trail"
      in order to be sure of making the last bus out of Kaprun back to
      Zell am See, and avoiding an hour-and-a-half walk back. This is
      when my knees and noodle-legs began to catch up with me. I had
      been fantasizing about going downhill when struggling up the
      mountain only an hour before, but I had forgotten that downhill
      would mean I would have to keep using my exhausted leg muscles
      to take tiny steps and avoid sliding down the mountain on my
      butt. I was mostly, but not completely successful at this.
      Though I never would have thought it possible while striving
      towards the peak, I began looking forward to the uphill sections
      to give my knees a brief respite. It wouldn't have been so bad,
      except that we realized upon further time checks that we really
      didn't have a moment to spare if we wanted to make the last bus.
      So I wobbled my way on my worn-out legs with very few breaks
      down the steep mountainside.
    </p>

    <p>
      We made the bus with seconds to spare. We weren't exactly sure
      where the stop was, so thankfully Adam followed his gut up to
      where it actually pulled up, while Maggie and I were exploring
      the parking lot below. We actually ran back uphill the last few
      feet, while Adam attempted to stall the (thankfully patient)
      driver with his lack of German.
    </p>

    <p>
      We stopped at the grocery store for some dinner ingredients
      before hobbling back up the hill to start cooking our feast:
      pesto pasta with zucchini, tomatoes and some white beans for
      protein. To this day (nearly a month later) there are still
      faint bruises under my big toenail from my feet sliding forward
      in my too-small tennis shoes as I slipped my way down the
      mountain, and that was the least of my aches. So needless to say
      I was "worn slick" to quote my grandma again, that evening.
      It was an early night after an exhausting but rewarding day.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next day proved to be more cloudy and rainy, but not quite
      as wet as we had feared, so we decided to take the cable-car up
      another peak and stroll around there. Well, hobble in my case.
      The uphills were actually ok, but I clutched the railing when we
      had to descend any stairs, for fear of my still noodle-y legs
      giving out on me and pitching me headfirst to the bottom. My
      burning shins informed me of even the tiniest downhill slope. We
      had a nice time though&mdash;taking more pictures, and being glad our
      big hike had been the day before, since the distant peaks were
      all mist-shrouded that day, and the views from the top we had
      gotten would have been impossible a day later. We were able to
      make out where we had been yesterday though, which was neat.
    </p>

    <p>
      We had another picnic where we discussed cultural appropriation
      and the various classes we had all taken in college, before
      strolling over to the chair lift that would take us down another
      route. We even discovered a child-less playground with slides
      that followed the contour of the hill, and a zip-line which we
      had to make use of. The slide time was a speedy 7 seconds of
      whooshing before it shot you out at the bottom. It's good to
      embrace your inner child every once in a while. They also had
      informative signs about the alpine flora and fauna, as well as
      some giant wood carvings of animals along the path, which was
      fun.
    </p>

    <p>
      The chair lift down was cooler than the cable-car ride up,
      because you didn't have reflective glass or other people
      interfering with the views, and plenty of fresh mountain air. We
      eventually made it back to the apartment, and made another
      delicious meal of curry with spinach, garbanzo beans, peas and
      coconut milk. The rainy night encouraged us to stay in again.
      Although Maggie and I did venture out in hopes of catching the
      sunset, it was unfortunately too cloudy to see much of anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a properly rainy day when we woke up the next morning,
      and even Maggie only went for a short run if I remember
      correctly. Adam and I slept in, then lounged around the house
      and I read my book&mdash;every vacation has to have <em>some</em> lazy
      time, right? Maggie did not agree, and went to the pool to swim
      laps. After she got back, we set off on a relaxing stroll around
      the lake, despite the rain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Adam's kneed started hurting when we were about halfway around
      the lake, even though there had been no pin-point-able injury.
      Unfortunately, it started really hurting when we were taking a
      mountain path as a detour up and around some road construction.
      We did see some cool signs about famous Austrians along the
      trail though, along with some interesting sculptures. We also
      got a better lookout over the cloudy peaks across the lake,
      where the day's rain had been snow at the higher elevation, and
      the line of white was noticeably farther down the mountain. We
      patted ourselves on the back once again for getting our hike in
      on the last possible day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately for Adam, there was no bus that would have taken
      him back around the lake, so there was nothing left to do but
      limp through the 8 mile round trip. It was nearly dark by the
      time we made it back to Zell and the apartment. Our curried
      fried rice was not quite as delicious as the curry and pesto
      pasta had been on the previous nights (we didn't want to buy a
      whole bottle of soy sauce we would just have to leave behind…)
      but we were proud to have used up almost exactly all of the food
      we had bought for the trip. We resolved the complex web of debt,
      payed up, and made plans for the next morning's check-out before
      packing up and heading to bed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maggie headed out early in the morning, saying farewell and
      promising to make plans of future adventures to come. She had to
      catch a train to Tübingin, where she would visit her
      study-abroad pals. Adam and I finished up in the apartment and
      headed out a few hours later to catch our own train to
      Pforzheim.
    </p>

    <p>
      My first and last photos of the train station in Zell are
      noticeably different. Autumn had made it's mark in the redder
      leaves and lowered snow-line on the mountains, even in the few
      days we were there. It was a wonderful trip, in the nick of
      time.
