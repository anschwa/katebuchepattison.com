  <h1>Moving to Gehlsdorf</h1>
  <time datetime="2021-09-28" class="italic">September, 28 2021</time>

  <p>
    On the 14<sup>th</sup> of September we were able to move into our
    lovely ground floor apartment with a nice little garden, across
    the river in Gehlsdorf. You can see some pictures here:
    <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/u6wCjHegSGZBHBUW7">https://photos.app.goo.gl/u6wCjHegSGZBHBUW7</a>

    Luckily my coworkers are all lovely and Gabbi, the English
    department head offered to drive our stuff over from KTV, which
    was quite helpful, since navigating that many bags on multiple
    trams and busses wouldn't have been ideal. As it was everything
    went quite smoothly, and we happily began unpacking. The very next
    day, a friend I met 10 years ago during my exchange in high school
    in Pforzheim Germany came for a quick visit on her way from
    Konstanz (waaaay down in southern Germany) to Hamburg. It's always
    lovely to see an old friend, and it was nice to be able to host
    Ellen and meet her new boyfriend for dinner in our more spacious
    apartment. This was from our stroll at dusk:

      />
    </a>

  <p>
  We had a lovely walk around the old town the second night they were
  here (staying in an airbnb near Steintor, so we could have some
  space to unpack). We were lucky enough to have mostly good weather
  too, so they were able to go to enjoy the beach at Warnemünde while
  I was at work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gabbi and her husband Frank offered to take Adam and I on an
    adventure the following Saturday, and we eagerly agreed. They
    picked us up around 10 am, and after running into our new
    neighbor, who owned the small childcare center where their son
    used to go as a toddler, they had to get a quick tour before we
    set off. We headed south, and I felt right at home as we pulled
    onto the autobahn and Frank started accelerating. After a while
    Gabbi looked over at the speedometer and gave Frank a light smack,
    after which he reluctantly slowed down a by a few kilometers per
    hour. It felt basically like being in the car with my parents! Our
    first stop was in Lalendorf, where we saw the oldest USSR tank
    still in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Pretty much, it was a tank, but
    it did look a bit different from the ones you see in the US.
  </p>

  <p>
    From there we drove on in lovely meandering sort of way, stopping
    at several intriguing churches, some of which had stars of David
    in the stone and stained glass work, which was curious.
    Unfortunately the castle we stopped at in Basedow bei Teterow had
    been bought by someone as a vacation hope a few years back, so we
    could only look at it from afar. We did however stop for some
    refreshments in what was once the smithy, where we could look
    through the wide variety of knick-knacks they had on display. We
    were also able to walk up the hill and go inside the little church
    there, which had some lovely woodwork on the organ and pews. As we
    walked around we noticed several examples of the classic Hanseatic
    architecture, with the stair-stepped front facade, complete with
    little arches. Most impressive to me was the building that was
    topped by a gigantic stork's nest, completely overshadowing any
    intentional human embellishments. This bike rack also made me
    smile&mdash;the quote is <q>Life is like a bike. You have to keep
    moving forward so you don't loose your balance.</q> which is always a
    good reminder. Also funny is what appears to be a punny
    advertisement for the nearby <q>Old Sheep-Stall</q> Cafe: <q>Break
    sharply!!</q> turned into <q>Break sheep-ly!</q>
  </p>

      one little <q>r</q> to get the sheep involved…

  <p>
    Eventually we made our way to Ivenack, our final destination. We
    parked and set off in search of the thousand year old oak trees we
    had come to see. Having been to the Redwoods themselves, Gabbi and
    Frank kept qualifying that these weren't nearly as big, but since
    I've never been to the west coast of my own country, it was pretty
    impressive for me! The trees themselves were quite large, but
    since oaks grow so slowly they were not actually as huge as you
    might imagine. What was more impressive to me was looking at the
    timeline, and contemplating how one plant could have existed for
    so much longer than the country I am from, let alone my tiny
    little life. I was also astounded by the completely unafraid deer
    we ran across, who continued to calmly munch on some grass, even
    though I was standing, taking pictures and talking not 10 feet
    away. Perhaps the coolest part was the winding elevated tree walk
    we took. It was a metal ramp that wound its way up above the
    treetops, so we could see the majestic oaks from above, as well as
    the nearby lakes, once we got to the top.
  </p>

  <p>
    in an effort to take a different route back to the car than the
    way we had arrived at the tree walk, we ended up taking a long
    detour around the lake. It was a nice walk though, and it wasn't
    even raining, which in Germany is something you really learn to
    appreciate, because of how often it IS raining…
  </p>

  <p>
    On the way back, we stopped in Dagrun at the castle/monastery (it
    had been both at various points in it's history) and walked around
    as they set up for a techno concert in the main courtyard&mdash;quite
    an interesting venue choice, talk about old and new mixing! We
    then ran across some apple and pear trees and grabbed a quick
    snack before heading back to Gabbi and Frank's house.
  </p>

    </a>

    <figcaption>
      Frank tried to throw rotten apples up at the tree to knock down
      a fresh one, but jumping for a lower hanging fruit did the trick
      in the end
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Upon arrival, Adam and Frank went out to cut up some wood for the
    fire-pit at our new apartment, which was a good few-words-required
    activity for them, as the language barrier was more significant
    there. Meanwhile, Gabbi and put on the squash soup to warm up, and
    I chopped up a fraction of one of her gargantuan garden-zucchini's
    for the cheese tart that would go with it. The language barrier
    was nonexistent for us, and we chatted away in both English and
    German.
  </p>

  <p>
    The food was ready in no time, and it was delicious as it
    sounds&mdash;the creamy squash soup had just enough spice, and the
    thyme, zucchini and gooey cheese paired perfectly with the crispy
    crust. Hmmmm…
  </p>

  <p>
    Adam and Frank continued to bond over their shared love of
    cocktails after dinner, as we heard stories of their extensive
    travels, and tried to guess where each picture in their living
    room was taken. This was all while listening to their extensive CD
    collection, including some fun modern polka bands and a
    wonderfully wacky Bosnian band. It was after midnight when Gabbi
    finally drove us home, but what a wonderful day it had been!
  </p>

  <p>
    Later that week we finally had a sunny afternoon (more often than
    it rains, it is extremely cloudy in Germany I have found, so you
    <em>REALLY</em> appreciate a properly sunny day) so Adam and I
    seized the opportunity to visit Petrikirche (St. Peter's Church)
    and climb up the spire for a clear view of the city. There was an
    interesting portrait exhibit on refugees in one of the ground
    floor rooms as well: drawing parallels between German refugees who
    had to flee during the war, and refugees who have come to Germany
    more recently.
  </p>

  <p>
    The spiral staircase up to the lookout in the bell-tower really
    put you in mind of it's roots in the middle ages, since it was so
    cramped and dark as it corkscrewed it's way up. The first church
    on the site was built in 1252, but being the tallest thing around,
    the tower was damaged by lightning and storms several times in the
    1500s. Each step was barely wide enough for the width of my feet,
    let alone the length! Luckily there was a rope handrail to clutch
    onto, which proved more important on the way down. The view at the
    top was really worth it though!

  <p>
    After leaving, we strolled through the old-town and found several
    more iconic examples of the hanseatic architecture, which can be
    seen in the last few photos on the google doc, which, once again
    can be found here: <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/u6wCjHegSGZBHBUW7">https://photos.app.goo.gl/u6wCjHegSGZBHBUW7</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    On Friday the 24<sup>th</sup>, we carefully cleaned the apartment, put all of
    our personal things into the storage room, and left the house to
    the airbnb guests who had booked it before we had signed the lease
    (that wouldn't officially begin until the 27th.) We had been able
    to move in two weeks early knowing we would have to be out for a
    weekend before the place was ours for good. It was a bit of a
    hassle, but since we didn't really have other lodging options, it
    worked out. And the best part was, since we had to find other
    lodging for the weekend anyway, we decided it might as well be in
    Copenhagan! So the next entry will be about just one weekend, but
    since we packed in so much to our time there, I can't promise it
    will be too much shorter…
    <p/>

    <p>
      Before leaving, we had to clean out the fridge, so I enjoyed
      this tasty and intriguing snack&mdash;cheese salad. I never expected
      anywhere to be able to out-cheese Wisconsin, but I have to hand
      it to those Leipzigers, we may try to sneak some cheese into
      salads of various types, but not even we would call something
      this cheese-based a <q>salad</q> I don't think. So needless to say I
      did had to try it when I found it in the store. It was pretty
      good actually!

      And on that cheesy note&mdash;see ya next time folks!
