  <h1>La Sierra a La Selva</h1>
  <time datetime="2015-11-11">November 11, 2015</time>

  <p>
    As most Ecuadorians are happy to tell you, this albeit small
    country nevertheless has a lot of diversity of climate. It is
    generally divided up into three regions, la sierra (the mountains)
    la selva or el oriente (the eastern jungle) and la coasta (the
    pacific coast) and if you really want to be thourough, there are
    also the Galapagos Islands, which are kinda their own thing, but
    certainly are also part of Ecuador. Quito, as "the highest
    official capital city in the world" (thanks Wikipedia) is most
    certainly in the mountains, and the "beach thing" was most
    certainly on the coast, so the only region that we hadn't seen yet
    was la selva- the Ecuadorian chunk of the famous amazonian rain
    forest. Since we were to have a long four day weekend because of
    "día de los difuntos" (day of the dead) celebrations, we decided
    to use this time to complete our tour of the 3 regions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Monday after the camping trip, those of us who had gone were
    to bring our rented sleeping bags and yellow fever vaccination
    certificates to Rodolfo's office before class. I had assumed that
    yellow fever must have been among the many vaccines I had gotten
    before getting on the plane and arriving in this country, but as
    we discovered later, I hadn't gotten that one, since I was told I
    wouldn't need it in Quito. The thing is that not only is it best
    to avoid this potentially fatal illness by way of vaccination when
    traveling to tropical rain forests, the scientific research
    station owned by the university also doesn't let you <em>in</em> without
    the certificate saying that you have it. It was Monday, and I
    didn't have it-great. So after getting some money, Rodolfo and I
    hopped in a taxi and headed to the historic district where there
    is a vaccination clinic.
  </p>

    <figcaption>
      I saw this next to the ATM: a vending machine full not of
      doritos, but paperbacks-much fewer calories I hear.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    According to the internet, the vaccination is not actually active
    until 10 days after you get it, and if we were leaving that
    Friday…but the station director said he would let it slide. After
    a painfully slow ride through congested morning traffic, we
    finally arrived at the clinic, where it was a remarkably easy
    process: upstairs, "no I am not allergic to chicken" (apparently
    that indicates that you will have problems with the vaccination
    too-I didn't even know you could be allergic to chicken…) and
    boom, I was vaccinated! We then went back downstairs to get the
    certificate, which was as free as the shot had been (absolutely)
    which was a nice plus to being unprepared-I saved hundreds of
    dollars spent by my compañeros who got the shot in the US-might
    have been better to get it done a week earlier, but…
  </p>

  <p>
    As we were winding our way out of the centro historico, we
    stumbled upon the highly formal ceremonial changing of the
    presidential guard, and in fact the president himself, overlooking
    it all from his balcony in la plaza de la independencia.

    The rest of the week was filled with scurrying around trying to
    get all the homework done before missing class to leave early
    Friday morning. Wednesday I skipped aerial silks to go to the
    colada morada (which is what Ximena made in that gigantic pot a
    few weeks go) and guaguas de pan event in the international
    programs office. Since we would be in the jungle during the day of
    the dead festivities, and would not have a chance to eat these
    traditional foods.
  </p>

  <p>
    To give some context, colada morada is a hot thick drink made from
    herbs, blackberry juice (I think…) and with pieces of
    strawberries, apples and pineapple. It is delicious but very sweet
    after drinking two mug fulls, as I discovered. Guaguas de pan are
    pieces of (often jam-filled) sweet bread shaped like babies
    (guagua, which is pronounced "wawa" is the word for child in the
    indigenous language of Kichwa) and these represent the rebirth
    that is intimately connected with death in many indigenous
    traditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had a nice long walk/wellie-buying adventure with Sarah, and
    when art class was canceled that evening, I printed off the group
    project essay about the obscure mural that we had researched, and
    was able to accompany Sarah and another Spanish class classmate to
    our French classmate's apartment, where he made us a delicious
    crepe dinner (if a Frenchman offers to cook you crepes, you
    accept, if at all possible, right?) and we spent a lovely evening
    chatting (mostly about Paris, where neither Sarah nor I knew
    enough to contribute much of anything…)
  </p>

  <p>
    Thursday brought an Otavalo-style pants (Otavalo is the indigenous
    community we visited all those months ago, the first weekend we
    were here) buying expedition with Tyler, and a skype information
    session about the wonders of the very first Earlham Ecuador
    program (recruiting for next year) in the afternoon. There was a
    minor freak-out later that night when I realized that my
    re-loadable credit card had no more money on it (and I couldn't
    remember how to reload it online) and I couldn't find my actual
    credit card-even after turning my room upside down. I called my
    lovely family late late at night, and they arranged to go to the
    bank and reload it for me before I was to leave the next
    morning-gotta love em.

      Otavalo pants: they are generally striped, brightly colored,
      with great pockets, and drawstrings at the waist and ankles, but
      most importantly for the rain forest: they cover you from scary
      creepy crawlies, AND breath easily.

  <p>
    Our group (James, Michelle, Minori, Tyler, Sarah, our Ecuadorian
    friend/anthropologist who is studying us Veronica, our fearless
    leader Rodolfo and I) met bright and early at the university's
    main entrance to await the first in many stages of transport we
    were to use that day: taxis to the airport. They were worryingly
    late in coming, but come they did, and we arrived in plenty of
    time at the airport that we had arrived to this country in almost
    exactly 3 months before. When we got there, I discovered where my
    other credit card had run off to…INSIDE MY PASSPORT!
  </p>

  <p>
    After deciding against buying some horrifically overpriced (that
    is, what you would pay anywhere in the US…) airport food we
    boarded the plane, and I had a nice chat with Minori, that seemed
    to just be getting started when we were already landing in the
    Coca airport.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stepping off an airplane to a radically different climate than the
    one in which you got on the plane is always a shocking experience,
    and I was not quite prepared for the wall of hot humidity that
    instantly enveloped me as I walked out of the doors. I don't know
    what I was expecting, but after leaving the cloudy chill of Quito,
    this weather that instantly coated me in a fine layer of sweat was
    certainly more stark a contrast than I was prepared for. After
    collecting our bags, and attempting to reconcile ourselves to the
    change in climate, we got into truck-taxis that were to take us
    the next leg of our journey. After a pit stop for some empanadas
    (rather longer than expected, since we got to talking about
    politics) we continued on our way, which was eventually stopped by
    the river we needed to cross by canoe. After a wait, our next mode
    of transport arrived, and cross the river we did. After scanning
    our bags and showing our passports, we then got in our fifth form
    of transportation for the day, a 15 passenger van, which at long
    last took us to the scientific research station in Yasuní national
    park, owned by our very own PUCE (Potificia Universidad Catolica
    del Ecuador).
  </p>

  <p>
    We were shown to our blessedly air-conditioned rooms, and told
    that dinner would be at 7 sharp (we took that with a large grain
    of salt-'this is Ecuador' we thought, '"sharp" means within half
    an hour') after dinner we fought off our travel fatigue to have an
    abbreviated version of Rodolfo's class before drifting off to
    sleep.

    The next morning we rose for breakfast at 7 (they weren't kidding
    about that punctuality thing-we were told off for arriving 5
    minutes late--we think it is these exact sciency types that are
    actually punctual in a culture that seems to suffer remarkably
    little from their chronic tardiness) After breakfast, we prepared
    for our first excursion into la selva. As we got fitted for life
    jackets to prepare for the canoe ride that was to proceed our
    hike, we saw these guys:

    <figcaption>
      Our friend the Tapir (allegedly cousins to elephants, but we
      agreed that the face was more anteater) These ones are
      semi-domesticated, and hence we pet them while they ate the
      platanos we gave them.

    We then boarded the canoes.

  </figure>

  <p>
    After a windy ride in the motorized canoe, we arrived at an
    extremely muddy riverbank, where we began our hike with our native
    Waorani guide. It was shocking in some ways the odd degree of
    familiarity there was while walking through the jungle. Despite
    its obvious differences of flora, I was struck with the perhaps
    obvious realization that it was still a forest, and walking
    through the forests (albeit those of the United State's upper
    Midwest) is nothing new to me. I think I just had this image of
    the Amazonian rain forest as this utterly exotic terrain,
    completely foreign- almost of another planet. The fact is (despite
    the myriad differences) at the root of the thing, a forest is
    still a forest--anywhere in the world, just like people are still
    just people, no matter how seemingly different.
  </p>

  <p>
    We ended up having lots of free time in the afternoons, after
    returning from our muddy, sweaty adventures, and we made the most
    of this time (I was sorely tempted to use the Spanish verb
    "aprovechar" there, since it seems to have a much richer meaning
    that "take advantage of"…) to hangout in one of our air
    conditioned rooms, chatting and bonding the hours away.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the evenings, we watched movies vaguely related to Rodolfo's
    class. After the first one Minori asked "Is this one going to be
    about indigenous people again? Does that mean they are all going
    to die again?" which pretty well sums up the representation of the
    bloody but historical plots.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sunday's excursion took us a little ways into the woods and then
    to a large metal tower/cage thing. We strapped on our harnesses
    and helmets and climbed and clipped our way up one by one, as high
    as our various comfort levels allowed. The view from the top was
    indeed stunning, but perhaps more so, were the bugs. The
    incredibleness of the view showed the expansive forest spreading
    out in all directions, as we ended up just even with the tallest
    of the trees, rising above the main canopy of the jungle-really
    wonderful. Meanwhile, the gnats provided a very distinctive
    ambiance in the form of that infuriating buzzing sound in our
    ears, as they formed a constant whirring cloud around our dripping
    faces, not infrequently flying directly into our eyes, for added
    emphasis. We all developed different coping strategies, involving
    hoods, elaborate patterns of waving our grippy climbing gloves in
    front of our faces, applying a visible layer of bug spray to the
    helmets and everything else, turtling inside our shirts, and
    occasionally shrieking in fury.

    I honestly can't remember which afternoon it was now, but one of
    the days, after returning and removing the mornings worth of grime
    from our bodies, and eating some lunch, we set out in the van to
    visit the nearest Waorani community. The Waorani are one of the
    biggest tribes in the area, and the three anthropologists who were
    staying at the research station with us are working with the
    community, because there are some interesting cultural changes
    going on right now. The tribe's first "contact" with
    western/mestizo/vaguely europeanized culture was not until the
    1950s. Before that time the people hunted with their traditional
    blow-guns, and wore their traditional (minimalist if existent
    clothing and jewelry-because who really wants to wear cloths in
    that humidity?) and only about 65 years later, the youth now have
    cell phones and Facebook, which is sure to cause some interesting
    cultural upheavals.
  </p>

  <p>
    We arrived in the middle of a soccer game, and were shepherded
    through the field to where some of the artisans had their wares
    layed out for us to buy, such as earings made of red and black
    seeds (bought some of those for Ximena, whose birthday I was
    missing because of the trip) and other such treasures. We then
    were shown a chant and dance done by some of the women, one of
    whom had a monkey clinging to her neck and hair the entire time we
    were there. We then got a brief tour of the traditional lodge, and
    then proceeded to spin around and play with some of the energetic
    and fearless youngsters, until it was time to go.
  </p>

  <p>
    Monday took us on a walk past another river, through impressive
    amounts of mud, and past <em>large</em> trees. Our guide was
    making a basket woven out of palm leaves, so I picked up the other
    half of the frond that she had ripped off and wove a fan for
    myself, following suit. I also collected some leaves that are
    allegedly used as shampoo by the Waorani.

    Before we knew it, it was Tuesday morning, and our long weekend
    was drawing to a close. I decided to use those handy dandy shampoo
    leaves to at least start the day clean before a long sweaty
    journey.

    </a>

    <figcaption>
      I guess it is a good thing I don't use these every time I
      shower, since this time, not only was the shower covered in the
      usual smears of long hair, it was also littered with shredded
      shampoo leaves…
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    I was told to twist and mash the leaves, and that a soapy liquid
    would come out. Upon doing this I was indeed greeted with a
    greenish slippery/sticky liquid that I rubbed into my scalp as
    best I could…After marginal success in my endeavor, and our
    punctual breakfast, we loaded our stuff into the vans once more
    for the return trekk.
  </p>

  <p>
    We ended up having a lot of time to kill in Coca before our flight
    (since the van to canoe to taxi truck part of the journey was much
    less full of delays than when we arrived. After a mediocre but
    very expensive lunch in a hotel (it was worth it because we could
    leave our stuff there while we explored) we took a stroll along
    the river, bought some jewelry at the artisan market, hung around
    the cultural museum where we saw some of the Waorani community
    members we had met photographed in an exposition. It was
    eventually time to go back to the tiny airport, say goodbye to the
    humidly and board the plane back to Quito once again.

  <p>
    I have always loved the stomach dropping feeling of the moment of
    takeoff and landing an airplane, it never fails to be
    exhilarating, perhaps because I don't experience it all that
    often. I couldn't help snapping photo after photo, since I hadn't
    had a window seat on the other flight, so here are only a few, if
    you can believe it.

      We were shocked to see houses quite that close to the runway, I
      don't think that would happen in the USA…

  <p>
    After a bit of homework that I hadn't done over the weekend, I
    looked out the window, and we had already arrived back to the now
    familiar landscape of la sierra of Quito.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <a href="img/IMG_1803.jpg">
      <img
        src="img/IMG_1803-225x300.jpg"

    </a>

    <figcaption>
      Maybe it is familiar because those contours are just a huger
      version of the Driftless region of Wisconsin…
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The feeling of stepping off the plane to the refreshingly chilly
    wind and cloudy evening of what I realized really did feel like a
    home to me was surprisingly contented. Whereas returning to Quito
    after the beach had brought a heavy dose of melancholy, this
    return really felt like I was back were I belonged again-glad I
    had gone, but glad to return as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    I returned home to a much needed shower after the fresh sweat of
    the journey and the dubious state of cleanliness that the shampoo
    had left my hair in. Soon after eating some dinner, and recounting
    of some of my adventures to Ximena and Gustavo, I collapsed
    (without blogging-hence you are getting the story only now) into
    my own bed again.
