  <h1>The Wonders of a Bucket List</h1>
  <time datetime="2015-10-26">October 26, 2015</time>

  <p>
    After completing my reflective post about being halfway through
    the program last week, I started to get inspired and excited to do
    all of those things. It was bucket list time. So I started a note
    on my phone with all the exciting things that remain yet un-done,
    un-tasted, un-felt for me in this vibrant country. This basically
    re-affirmed for me the power of words, which I have long believed
    strongly in, because as soon as I wrote down the things I wanted
    to to it upped the pressure for me to actually do them all, and
    made me excited for them. The highlights include: climb Pichincha
    the (inactive) volcano for which this province is named, explore
    the adorable parks, coffee shops and international movie theaters
    in the neighborhood, and broad things like try all the typically
    Ecuadorian food I have not yet tasted that isn't meat (we shall
    see how that goes-this place has an astounding variety of foods)
    and visit all the nearby attractions I have not yet seen.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tuesday, Sarah and I checked off one of the things when we met for
    chai at one of the aforementioned cute coffee shops in the
    afternoon. We are thinking of making it a routine.
  </p>

  <p>
    The rest of the week was rather uneventful. We watched a movie
    called "El cartero de Neruda" in Spanish class on Wednesday (I
    think it was) about the Nobel Prize winning Chilean poet Pablo
    Neruda's political exile in Italy and the friendship that
    developed between him and his post boy. As part of the weekly quiz
    on Friday we had to write a review of it and either recommend it
    (or not) to our friends, so here goes: it was a well done drama
    that "vale la pena verla" which is a wonderful Spanish saying that
    literally means: "it's worth the pain to see it" which despite how
    odd and extreme it sounds when you translate it to English, is a
    widely used saying meaning more logically translated: "its worth
    it"
  </p>

  <p>
    Friday we went as a class to "El Museo de la Ciudad" where we went
    through well put together exhibits depicting Ecuadorian history
    through the ages. Afterwards, I stayed to do some research about
    the mural that I have to write 2000 words about by this Wednesday
    with the compañero with whom I went to see the soggy mural last
    week. I found one frustratingly general paragraph that actually
    talked about the mural in the four large books I consulted. Alas
    alas. I had no trouble finding my way back to school this time
    though, because I didn't even try to mess with the buses, and just
    got straight into a taxi. I was worried about arriving 10 minutes
    late to Rodolfo's class, but when I met him in the elevator going
    up, I was less worried!

    We (Sarah, Tyler, James and I) were planning on going on the
    all-volunteer groups camping trip that weekend. We had very little
    information, but we heard mural painting and camping, so we were
    in. We had heard we were leaving at 5 pm (we later found out that
    Rodolfo misread 15:00 as 5:00…) so my plan was to run home and
    grab my stuff after class, then embark from there. We got a
    message at about 3:20 that the bus was leaving at 3:30. We were in
    the middle of getting all the information about our upcoming trip
    to Yasuní scientific research station in the Amazonian rainforest,
    so we couldn't really leave early, plus I didn't have my stuff…At
    4 I dashed home, shoved my remaining things in a bag, and took a
    taxi back by 4:30ish, but the bus had already left. So I went with
    some other late comers in the coordinator's truck (slightly scary,
    since he was in a HURRY. There were definitely moments when we
    were passing several cars at once, speeding by them all in the
    wrong lane…) but even though we stopped to buy some butter, we
    still arrived before the buses. We showed up to a semicircle of 13
    traditional A shaped tents. There were 120 of us. I was placed in
    "carpa numero tres" with a leader and 5 other girls, which was a
    tight squeeze, let me tell you! I think we might all have been
    able to lie on our backs and have room for all those shoulders, if
    we were touching, the guys who had 9 to a tent on the other hand
    were certainly not as lucky.
  </p>

  <p>
    The weekend as a whole pretty much felt like a strange mix of New
    Student Orientation at college, and my beloved Kamp Kenwood,
    except volunteering style…Friday night was a lot of goofy
    get-acquainted with your tent games, then some very solemn
    announcements about how important the work we were about to do
    was, and how we were the people who were going to save the world.
    Tyler and I decided, it was a BIT over-dramatized, but anyway. We
    met some cool people, and had some nice guitar circle sing-alongs
    to songs that none of us from the states knew, and did some
    dancing and performing of silly skits (I told you it was like
    camp!) I did have a pretty good translation mix up somewhere along
    the way too. I was translating the story of a fellow exchange
    student from another university who got robbed near school by two
    guys with big knives who jumped out of a taxi in broad
    daylight…except in my version of the story they pulled out two
    huge SPOONS, instead of knives (cuchara=spoon while
    cuchillo=knife…now I won't forget anymore!) providing a mental
    image to my listeners that was rather more comical than menacing…

    We rose early on Saturday, did some wake-up exercises, then got
    some breakfast, did an activity about social
    justice/responsibility and volunteerism, then headed to the buses
    that took us to the school where we began painting. I was assigned
    green. And then blue-nothing fancy, or artsy, but that was alright
    with me, got to chat with some new people as we methodically and
    meditatively re-colored the peeling cinder block walls with fresh
    springy colors.

    Sunday was a day of pomp and circumstance about how wonderful it
    was that we were volunteering (seriously, you would have thought
    that we had all dedicated a year of our lives to curing cancer or
    something, from the way they kept going on about it!) after
    breaking up into group discussions about the Jesuit social
    responsibility (like the day before) we this time made posters,
    and allllll 13 tents presented (whilst I sunburned my face
    watching them all) but eventually we piled back into the buses and
    returned to Quito. I had a lovely chat with Carol about her art
    and her life, and Quito's culture, as Sarah and Tyler napped away
    behind us.
  </p>

  <p>
    Upon arrival Sarah, Tyler and I left our sleeping bags in the
    volunteer coordinator's office, and took our filthy selves and
    large bags to get chinese food, then ice cream-a lovely post
    camping re-integration into city life. We then we split ways for
    some much needed bathing and relaxing before diving into another
    week.
