    The week was pretty much uneventful, until Thursday (the 19th)
    when we Earlhamites (+Veronica, who pretty much counts by now,
    especially after having traded Tyler's Earlham shirt for her PUCE
    shirt… ) which was when we left for our last group trip of the
    program: to Cuenca.
  </p>

  <p>
    At four we met up to get in some taxis for the last trip to the
    airport before the LAST trip to the airport (penultimate, would be
    a good word here…) We were our usual goofy and overly loud selves
    in the airport (my theory is that we can all pass as normal,
    rational humans on our own in the real world, but that somehow
    when all together our weirdness and quirkiness multiplies and we
    become the best kind of obviously odd) Anyway, in the shuffle of
    checking some bags and not others, the knitters I had converted to
    the cause (Minori and Sarah) decided that metal knitting needles
    might indeed be considered potential stabbing utensils when in the
    context of airport security, and therefore were afraid they would
    get confiscated, and <em>then</em> where would we be? Even though
    there was no comment about the 5 double pointed metal needles I
    carried on the plane to Yasuní. I eventually decided to check my
    knitting anyway, just to be safe; since it would be a shame to get
    my needles confiscated so close to hat completion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fast forward 10 minutes, and we are in the security line, everyone
    else already through, and only Rodolfo and I remaining. Where is
    my passport? But actually, where is it?! After going through the
    wonderful ritual of emptying my entire suitcase (underwear and
    all) in the middle of the airport, I finally realized that I must
    have accidentally checked it with my knitting in Sarah's bag. Wow,
    I am good at airports! After a few minutes of tense panic (I would
    not be able to fly without some form of picture ID, so that meant
    either my driver's license which was an hour away in la Floresta
    in my nightstand, or my passport that was in Sarah's bag, which
    was who knew where by then.) We eventually got a hold of Sarah,
    who snuck backwards through security, and we explained the
    situation/sweet-talked the airport people into letting her get
    access to her bag again, worried for a few horrifying seconds as
    she rummaged through her duffel, that I had in fact dropped my
    passport somewhere, rather than mistakenly checked it in her bag,
    and that it was even then being sold on the black market…
  </p>

  <p>
    The three of us finally exhaled when she triumphantly held up the
    small navy blue book-found at last. We ran through security just
    in time, and caught up to the rest of the group at our gate. I was
    enveloped by a very touching group hug and many exclamations of
    gratitude and joy (even a few tears) as they all told me how glad
    they were I had found it and my identity wasn't being pirated, and
    I wouldn't have to stay in Ecuador indeterminately until I could
    get a new Passport…All was well however, and we ended up having
    our gate changed and a delay in boarding, but after the previous
    worries, this seemed like nothing.
  </p>

  <p>
    We arrived in Cuenca starving, and checked into our rather
    luxurious hostel in the historic district, then proceeded to get
    some dinner at a "Chicago" style pizza restaurant. Michelle,
    Minori and I ate half of the largest vegetarian pizza I have ever
    seen (as in, I stretch my arms out into the biggest circle they
    can make and it was <em>that</em> big)
  </p>

  <p>
    After exploring our hostel balcony, and the other exciting
    features of our fancy new home, we went to bed fairly early.
    Friday morning I woke up early to get some homework done, and then
    we rushed through the last of our breakfast so that we could run
    to catch our 9 am tour of the historic district on a double decker
    tourist bus. The tour was interesting, and the translation of
    every phrase into English confused us a little about why they were
    saying everything twice, which I guess is a good sign for our
    audial (is that a word?) Spanish comprehension…We visited the
    Panama hat museum as part of the tour as well. Why you ask? They
    actually have nothing to do with Panama, except that was they
    place they were exported to (from Ecuador) and bought by Theodore
    Roosevelt during the canal construction, and thus the misnomer was
    born. They are actually a traditional Ecuadorian handcraft, woven
    from dried palm fronds, and costing anywhere between $30-$3000
    dollars, depending on the level of detail. We were sufficiently
    impressed, and Sarah and I were also confused at being asked to
    have our pictures with two random Ecuadorian guys also on the tour
    (we aren't from here, clearly, so…?)
  </p>

  <p>
    We had a few hours to wonder around the plaza central, and eat
    some lunch, before getting on the evening tour in the other
    direction. The highlight this time was the winding climb up to the
    mirador where we had a lovely view of Cuenca spread out below the
    dusky sky and us. We explored the church, took some cheesy group
    selfies, bought some canelazo to aid in our warming-ourselves-up
    efforts, and penguin huddled briefly to achieve that same end. I
    guess we had forgotten that, even though we were in a different
    city, this wasn't Bahía de Caraquez, or Yasuní, we were still in
    the Andes mountains, where it gets cold as the powerful sun leaves
    the sky. We were the only group valiant enough to brave the cold
    and wind on the top of the bus on the way back down the mountain,
    which meant that we were the only ones who got to see Tyler trying
    to throw the canelazo cups away. Ordinarily this wouldn't be such
    a great privilege, but because of the wind, the long trek to the
    front of the bus, and the low hanging branches and telephone
    wires, it was a rather perilous and therefore highly comical
    sight. The image of Tyler, stumbling and crouching down to avoid
    decapitation by telephone wires (looking rather like an orangutan
    in the process) while also trying to run to the front of the bus,
    as it careened at high speed down the curvaceous mountain road,
    throwing terrified looks over his shoulder at us, and shrieking as
    the cups were roughly blown out of his hand…I will probably never
    forget it.
  </p>

  <p>
    For dinner we had some Indian food (al estilo Ecuatoriano, with a
    popcorn bar and vaguely curry-inspired sauces to put on it), which
    we all partook in everyone else's food, as usual, creating a comic
    level of potluck-ness, as we all passed all our food to everyone.
    We waddled out about an hour or so later, stuffed with
    deliciousness, and began our search for a club.
  </p>

  <p>
    There were several bars, but the only club that seemed to promise
    dancing had a long line out the door, and when we asked the cost
    we were informed that Tyler's signature basketball shorts were not
    acceptable in the strictly semi-formal club. We soon developed an
    elaborate plan that I still think would have been brilliant: James
    would go in with the rest of the girls (it didn't seem to matter
    that much what <em>we</em> were
    wearing, and we got in free "because girls can sometimes like
    hanging out with other girls for a ladies night, but guys always
    want girls, so they let us in free, because then the guys will
    come" according to Veronica) so James would go in with us, go to
    the bathroom, take off his pants, and somehow throw them out of
    the men's bathroom to one of us, who would smuggle them out to a
    waiting Tyler. Phase II: Tyler would miraculously manage to
    discreetly change into James' pants on the busy street, then he
    would get in without a problem, go to the bathroom, give James his
    pants back, and change into his shorts again. It was obviously a
    pretty foolproof plan, because he would thereby have avoided the
    wardrobe police who we assumed to be concentrated at the door.
    What could have possibly gone wrong? But a more logical plan
    reigned in the end: the three men taxied back to the hostel, where
    James lent Tyler some appropriate club-wear. Two Jameses arrived
    at the club about half an hour later, one with a runner's body
    type instead of a football player's…We had a couple hours of group
    dancing in a circle of friends, using Tyler and James as fake
    boyfriends as needed, to deter overeager men who wanted to pull us
    away.
  </p>

  <p>
    The night got rather interesting when Tyler decided he was too hot
    in the stuffy room with his long sleeved shirt under James' button
    up. I hollered into his ear over the music "Just take off the
    bottom layer then" and thus it began. Lacking the handy skill that
    many women posses of changing in public by not actually ever
    completely taking off your shirt, Tyler instead had to unbutton
    and completely remove both shirts, before putting the short
    sleeved button-up back on. Seeing this, Veronica jokingly cheered,
    as though he were starting his striptease act, thus, more people
    than were already staring at our large group of gringos, looked
    our way too. That was when, in the flustered process of chasing
    his sleeve around like a dog's tail, attempting to dress himself,
    his pants (several sizes too big) fell down. Tyler (naturally)
    shrieked, attracting what must have been the rest of the dance
    floor's attention our way, as he stood there, pants around his
    ankles, and his shirt half on…Minori responded by sliding down the
    wall into the fetal position, convulsing with waves of laughter,
    and the others had similar reactions of disbelief. Thus, I rushed
    over and yanked his pants up, as he finally got his wardrobe in
    order…We then developed an elaborate system of tying his shirt
    through his belt loops with several hairbands, to avoid any future
    fiascos. I spent the rest of that wacky night dancing with those
    wonderful people I am growing to love more everyday.
  </p>

  <p>
    Saturday took us in a van to the Cañari ruins of Ingapirca, a few
    hours away. The car ride provided ample time to knit, attempt
    homework (unsuccessful) sleep, and for Veronica and I (the only
    ones with semi-catholic backgrounds) to explain to Tyler and
    Michelle that yes, all of the virgin statues and paintings around
    the world do, in fact all represent the very same virgin Mary.
    Despite having other titles added such as Guadalupe, they still
    represent the original Mary, and that no, they are not any old
    virgin from down the road ("Oh, I always though that if you died
    without having sex then they made a statue of you" no Michelle,
    not quite…)
  </p>

  <p>
    The tour was quite interesting, the free-roaming llamas adding to
    the possibility of imagining that the people who had left behind
    these crumbling foundations were just over the next hill. We
    learned how this lunar-worshiping culture had been subsumed by the
    solar centric religious system of the conquering Incas, and saw
    some of their astronomical observation tools. A few of the
    structures were remarkably similar to the ancient ones of New
    Grange that I had the opportunity to see in Ireland.
  </p>

  <p>
    From there, we went to a town famous for its gold and silver
    jewelry. I somehow restrained myself from buying any more
    earrings, and limited myself to some ice cream, even as we
    strolled through all the shops that lined the main square, all of
    which were packed with lovely rings, necklaces and earrings.
  </p>

  <p>
    We stopped for what turned out to be an early dinner in el mercado
    in a small town on the way back. We decided that Tyler's health
    inspector mother would have had a heart attack at the open doors,
    let alone the flies and the large knives being used in such close
    proximity to small children…But I love going to markets, I guess
    because everything just feels so much more intimate and immediate.
    You get to see the whole process, since they don't hide anything
    like is so often the case in the States. Michelle was repulsed by
    the wafts of smoke that issued from the row of stalls roasting cuy
    (guinea pig, remember?) over open fires, but I was drawn in
    despite my vegetarianism. We visited the upper level, which
    contained the largest number of roasted whole pigs I have ever
    seen, we bought something like $2 worth of mote (a type of corn)
    and beans, which turned out to be half a shopping bag full, and
    some tortillas de choclo, which are sweet corn pancakes with
    cheese, which were also delicious.
  </p>

  <p>
    We piled back into our trusty van just as the rain started, and
    arrived for a cozy night in our hostel, too tired and dry to want
    to go out into the rainy night. After several failed attempts to
    scrape together enough internet to watch the Japanese anime
    "Spirited Away" (only succeeding in loading the add "Sprited Away"
    about 5 times…) We gave up and just hung out, ordering another
    enormous pizza sometime around 10 pm. Michelle, Veronica, Minori
    and I ended up staying up till 3am talking about everything from
    relationships, Christmas, knitting, and religions of the world,
    all with Tyler passed out face down on the bed between us,
    occasionally rolling over and muttering incoherently in his sleep.
    We decided it is the best group of people with whom (my
    grandmother will have to inform me if that was the correct usage
    of that word…) one can stay up talking about "slightly shallow but
    some kinda important topics" with, until all hours of the night,
    in the wise words of Minori.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sunday we woke up rather late and started on our investigative
    project that Rodolfo had assigned. We broke into several groups to
    tackle the 14 questions, interviewing locals and turistas alike,
    mapping out la plaza central, visiting museums and statues, eating
    in another market, and all photographing everything that seemed
    remotely important. We returned from a day of much walking, to the
    hostel, were we were informed our flight was at least 2 hours
    delayed, if not canceled altogether. We thus left for a leisurely
    dinner before confirming we had an airplane to get onto, and
    heading to the airport. We finally arrived back to Quito and to
    our beds at about 1:30 (at which time I still had to finish my
    homework) and then slept precious few hours before the penultimate
    Monday of normal classes in Ecuador.
