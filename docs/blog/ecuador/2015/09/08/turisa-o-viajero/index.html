  <p>
    This is a dangerous game I am playing-because I now have 2 weeks
    to tell you about, rather than just one… But luckily I really do
    think a routine is now something I pretty much have…Time is such a
    fluid concept for me here, some days feel like weeks, others like
    minutes, but somehow all of that has added up to more than a month
    by now ¡Que loco!
  </p>

  <p>
    I will try and remember back to all the things that have happened
    in the last 2 weeks, as an exercise for my memory if nothing else!<br />
    I think it makes sense to break this up into two sections, to
    avoid the extreme long-ness that can sometimes afflict my
    posts…
  </p>

  <p>
    The week after the "Somos Cuy" frustration was indeed smoother,
    going to classes, knowing where and when they were--fairly
    uneventful except for finding this fantastically convenient
    climbing gym a few blocks from my house-an extremely exciting
    moment to be sure-my plan is to wait 2 more weeks (in which I will
    test it out) then get the 3 month pass so that it will last the
    rest of my time here-Michelle (a fellow Earlhamite here) and I are
    trying to devise a plan to go on Tuesday evenings after my class…

      My Spanish class went on a field trip to a local museum-I have
      many MANY pictures, but will only show one here, since I though
      it interesting…

  <p>
    We had our first class with Rodolfo (the only class we Earlham
    students all have together) on that Friday. We debriefed about
    culture shock, complained (a necesarily cleansing experiense every
    once in a while) and then moved into a discussion of what a travel
    narrative is, since the class is called "Andean Travel
    Narratives".
  </p>

  <p>
    It was quite interesting, and we finally decided that
    there are two types of modern travelers: "turistas" and "viajeros"
    (tourists and journeyers.) Their goals are utterly different we
    decided: tourists really just want to relax in a place that is
    away from the drudgery of everyday life, journeyers, on the other
    hand, are interested in immersing themselves in the everyday life
    and culture of a place, having an "authentic" experience,
    suffering hardships, and coming back changed-wiser in the ways of
    the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also acknowledged a time difference, because many
    journeyers are not confined to summer vacation, but instead often
    stay for longer periods of time. We discussed the journeyers
    contempt for the tourist, and the need to distance themselves form
    tourists, in the stereotypical sense of the white, sunburned,
    culturally insensitive, beach-goers who speak Spanish-or whatever
    language-with a heavy United States accent, if they try at all.
    But then again, it was pointed out-aren't all travelers tourists
    in a certain sense, because they are in fact "tour-ing" a new
    place? So what does that make us, we wondered? We are certainly
    not here to relax (at least not as the primary goal) we do hope to
    return wiser in the ways of the world, and as the last post
    probably made abundantly clear-we are certainly suffering our fair
    share…we are living with Ecuadorian families going to and
    Ecuadorian university, an experience we believe to be
    authentic…but at the same time we do visit the touristy spots, and
    are certainly far from blending in with the locals in many
    regards…
  </p>

  <p>
    It was certainly an interesting discussion, one that I
    have struggled with myself for a long time now, and have continued
    to think about. Why do I feel such a strong (actually pretty
    snobbish) need to differentiate between the kind of traveling I am
    doing and the kind done by mere <em>tourists</em>? When in fact the activities may not be that different…
  </p>

  <p>
    Saturday morning Ximena and I picked up Tyler and Sarah and we
    drove to Lloa (Yo-ah) for a hike and a swim (I am beginning to
    detect a pattern that I quite enjoy in my family's Saturday
    activities…) If I were to describe the hike in 3 words they would
    be: DUSTY, treacherous, and exciting.

    We sort of forgot about eating lunch, but were sustained pretty
    well on popcorn, and after washing some of the dust off of
    ourselves in the pools and waterfall (although the net effect was
    probably not any cleaner because of the mineral-rich clay we
    smeared on our faces…) we got in the car and drove back to Quito.
    Ximena and I showered and ended up too hungry to really cook
    anything, after not having eaten anything substantial since
    breakfast, and it was then 6:00 (she was even too hungry to get
    dressed) and so we huddled in the kitchen, her in her towel,
    shoving whatever food we could find into our faces: carrots,
    tomatoes, cheese, bananas…
  </p>

  <p>
    After a bit of relaxation, Sarah Tyler and I met at his house to
    go clubbing (as if we weren't exhausted enough!) Once we finally
    found a taxi, and then a club that actually had both decent music
    and people dancing to it, we went in, and joined the party.
    Tyler's stomachache sent him home pretty quickly after we arrived,
    but Sarah and I stayed and soon found partners to try out our
    salsa and meringue moves with. It was a fun time (once I convinced
    my partner that even though his friend was making out, I had a
    boyfriend, and so wasn't going to, no matter how many times he
    told me I was pretty (guapa, heromosa, linda), or that I was a
    good dancer, and yes I knew very well that my boyfriend wasn't
    there, but that's not really the point is it?) once we got that
    all straightened out, it was a fun night of dancing, and after
    making our excuses Sarah and I finally left, hours later. I
    collapsed in bed utterly exhausted, sometime well past midnight.
  </p>

  <p>
    The next morning we three rose early (for a weekend anyway) and
    met at Tyler's house at 8:30 to help set up for his host sister's
    baby shower. It was an interesting experience, with lots of food
    (almost none of which my vegetarian self could eat) there were
    shish-kabobs, sushi (complete with Ecuadorian plantains…) fancy
    fruit cocktails, and the like. There were many of the silly
    baby-shower games that you might find in the States as well, but
    it was mostly a nice family party (men and women.) So by the time
    that wrapped up, we parted ways and headed home for a Sunday
    evening of untouched homework, and no time to blog about it.

    And now I have some other kind of random pictures that might
    interest people but that don't necessarily fit anywhere logical,
    so I decided to tack them on the end of this…
