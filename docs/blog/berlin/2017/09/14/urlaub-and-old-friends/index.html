  <h1>Urlaub And Old Friends</h1>
  <time datetime="2017-09-14"pubdate>September 14, 2017</time>

  <p>
    <strong>Wednesday</strong> morning was fairly relaxed: I walked
    through the rain to finally mail a package to a friend that I had been
    meaning to mail since I arrived (better late than never I guess!) then
    I slowly meandered to Tegel Airport, once again.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was happy to have a very uneventful flight to Stuttgart airport.
    Marie (the older sister of my exchange partner from high school)
    picked me up from the airport. It was so nice to see her again! It was
    a little less nice to drive home to Pforzheim through a lot of
    traffic.… We stopped at Lidl (grocery store) to get some Bretzeln (of
    course) when we got home. It felt just like the good old days when I
    was staying with them in high school, it didn't matter that there was
    a new house, and a new dog--I still fell right back into the old
    routines as if I had left yesterday, rather than 5 years ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    After eating a late lunch, Marie and I took Stella (the new dog) for
    a walk in the lovely meadow across the street, and were proud that
    we averted any escape attempts by, even when there was a very
    interesting bird that she darted after, pulling the leash out of
    Marie's hand, tangling it around her foot somehow, and causing her
    to crash into me!
  </p>

  <p>
    When the parents Jean-Yves and Christene got back from work, we all
    got in the car and drove to a nice Schwäbische Restaurant, as I was
    promised. It was very delicious, and I enjoyed the typisch Deutsche
    Essen that I hadn't had too much in Berlin, where I was busy eating
    Turkish, Thai, and Tibetan! It was so lovely to catch up with them,
    tell them about my internship, and my life in the last 5 years, and
    to hear all about theirs as well. After the kind waiter saved
    Jean-Yves from himself, by asking if he was SURE he wanted to give a
    50 Euro tip, and we paid a reasonable amount instead, we went on a
    digestive stroll through the city. It really was funny the way all
    the little details came back to me--here is where we always caught
    (or I got on the wrong) bus, there is where I had to go to get my
    visa renewed, that is where we would get coffee sometimes, that is
    the park where we watched the Euro-cup Fußball on the big
    screen…After a little more chatting when we got home, we all went
    off to bed--me to the skylighted attic, just like my old room in the
    other house.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Thursday</strong> morning started out slow, and after a
    typical Duetsch breakfast, we sorted through some of Christine's
    flee-market ready clothes, to see if there was anything we would
    want (I found 2 dresses that I didn't NEED, but really LIKED…) and
    we then went to a thrift store, since we hadn't had enough clothes
    somehow…It was fun to chat and catch up while making fun of the
    occasional ridiculous outfit. I ended up leaving with some striped
    overalls and another dress.
  </p>

  <p>
    After some shopping for dinner ingredients, we packed up Stella and
    met Christine and her horse Lucy at the stables, for a nice stroll
    through another meadow. I hadn't really realized how much I missed
    greenness living in a big city (despite all it's parks, Berlin is
    still a big city, with less green space than Westby WI or Richmond
    IN!) so I was happy soaking up the sunshine and greenness.
  </p>

  <p>
    We then went home, and Marie and I cooked some yummy fajita-inspired
    stir fry that we then burrito-ed up in some tortillas. It was pretty
    good, and Jean and Christine were happy that they didn't have to
    cook it. After dinner Marie and I walked down the hill to the ice
    cream place we always used to go to. We got there right as they were
    closing, but luckily they let us get our treat. We struggled back up
    the hill (it is rather steep, ok!) and eventually made it home. At
    one point Marie dropped her cone, and immediately picked it up and
    continued eating, the only appropriate response, really. Luckily she
    was about half done, and the ice cream was safely below the rim of
    the cone, so there wasn't really any harm done.<br />
    When we got home, the parents were watching a dubbed version of
    "American Ninja Warriors" which we then all proceeded to get way too
    invested in…Kinda funny though. Funny how I never watch these US
    shows in the US, but when I'm abroad…
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Friday</strong> morning Marie had to get back to school, so
    we dropped her off at the train station at the same time we picked
    Louisa up. Lou and I then went to lunch at a nice and pretty empty
    restaurant, and we caught up, since the last time we saw each other
    I hadn't even started my internship yet.
  </p>

  <p>
    After lunch, we went home to an interesting chat with Jean-Yves and
    Christine about the nuances of du and Sie (the formal and informal
    "you" singular pronouns) and when to use each. It is such a
    complicated issue, because every generation, and every person has a
    slightly different opinion about it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Louisa and I then ran some errands in the afternoon, so that by the
    time we got back it was already dinner time. We set the table in the
    backyard, and had a lovely dinner of more bread and all the cheeses
    and jams and meats (for them) that I remembered fondly. We lit the
    candles as it got dark, and chatted and chatted. I had forgotten
    what a goooofball Louisa is when she is with her family. So nice to
    be back in the old rhythms, and I was kind of glad we didn't do
    anything too spectacular, activity-wise, since my main goal was
    really just to see them all again. After dinner we played Mäxle (a
    cross between Yahtzee and BS, kinda…) which I am really bad at! I
    blame the weird way that Germans say their numbers…(32 is "two and
    thirty") but really I am also just a bad liar…but it was still fun.
    From there we drifted off to beds.
  </p>

  <p>
    We woke up on <strong>Saturday</strong> morning and dropped Louisa
    off at her bus stop, then Christine and Jean-Yves walked me to my
    train platform, so that there was no chance I could get lost, they
    had learned from last time I was with them! After all of these sad
    goodbyes, I got on the train towards Konstanz.
  </p>

  <p>
    I should probably do a bit of explaining about why I was going to
    Bodensee. While I was staying with the Kaisers (Louisa's family) in
    high school, I had to make a Rube Goldberg machine as a group
    project for our physics class, and this is where I made friends with
    Ellen. The same time I left the Goetheschule frei Waldorfschule
    Pforzheim, so did she, to move down to southern Germany to finish
    high school at another Waldorf school on the beautiful Lake
    Constance that shares a boarder with Switzerland, and had stunning
    views of the alps. Ellen and I kept in intermittent contact over the
    years--exchanging long emails every once and a while, updating each
    other on our studies, families, and travels. We hadn't been in
    contact too recently, until she surprised me with a nice email on my
    birthday, right before I came to Germany. This led to an exchange of
    Whatsapp numbers, and eventually this plan: for me to come down and
    visit her before I flew home to the US. As I sat on the train, I
    found myself wondering if it would be strange to see her again,
    since we hadn't seen each other in 5 years, and hadn't had much
    contact recently.
  </p>

  <p>
    When she picked me up on the platform in Konstanz however, it was
    totally natural, and it felt like we were just picking up where we
    left off, like it had with the Kaisers. First thing was first, we
    dealt with our immense hunger, by walking along the lake till we
    came to one of her favorite pizza restaurants. There we filled in a
    lot of the gaps between the emails over the years, and each managed
    to eat an entire pizza (no exactly personal sized either…)
  </p>

  <p>
    From there we strolled though the lovely town center a bit, did some
    shopping, then drove back to her apartment, where we changed into
    bikinis, and took the beautifully short walk downhill to the lake. I
    always love swimming in lakes and rivers, but I must say the
    experience was extra refreshing after the morning's train ride, and
    with a view of the Alps. One of Ellen's friends joined us
    eventually, and the three of us splashed around for a while, till
    the sun sunk behind the trees. We then walked back up to Ellen's
    apartment, to make some delicious Quiche, salad and apple bread. One
    of Ellen's housemates and his boyfriend joined us, and it was a
    really nice little group to cook and eat with. We ended up adding
    champaign to our classy meal on the balcony, with a view of the
    lake…Not that I don't love my housemates here in Foster House in
    Richmond Indiana, but classy isn't usually ow we get described… so
    it was nice to see another possible college experience. We played
    cards after dinner, and then finally ended up going to bed.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the time I woke up on <strong>Sunday</strong> morning, Ellen had
    already been studying for several hours, because my visit was
    basically right in the middle of her finals week! Just to give you
    an idea of how intense Ellen is, she had also just passed the
    qualifying rounds for her Southern German Championships in
    Judo…casually…
  </p>

  <p>
    After some breakfast on the balcony, we set off for the high ropes
    course in the woods not too far from her house. Despite the bugs, it
    turned out to be the perfect day to come, since it was apparently
    the emptiest it had been in weeks, so we had plenty of space to
    climb around without waiting on other groups. I had a very proud
    moment when the guy checking us in thought I was German, because he
    couldn't hear my accent at first! Granted, I had only said about 20
    words at that point…but still, I patted myself on the back.
  </p>

  <p>
    After we had done a number of routes through the trees, and
    over/under/through/around the obstacles, we decided to call it a
    day, and walked back home. The original plan was just to take a
    short nap then go swimming again, but it turned into a longer nap,
    which left no time for anything but a quick dinner before we drove
    to her Judo studio. She leads a workout class every Sunday evening
    for her friends and Judo-club members that is basically a "guts,
    butts and thighs" program. This is only a small side project in
    Ellen's workout regimen, by the way, she normally trains for around
    3-5 hours every day during the week, so Sunday is her day of rest!
    Lets just say I didn't do all of it, but was still exhausted at the
    end…THEN we walked the short distance to jump into the refreshingly
    cool lake.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the way home, we stopped at 3 different banks looking for a place
    where we could exchange Euros for Swiss Francs for tomorrows
    adventure to Zurich. After a bit of research about the best route
    tot the Zurich airport, we went off to bed.
  </p>

  <p>
    I awoke on my last full day in Germany (<strong>Monday</strong>)
    quite sore! We ate breakfast on the balcony once again (where she
    did admit that the climbing had made her pretty sore as well, which
    was a relief!) then we set off for Switzerland! Because the Swiss
    are weird (It has to be said) they don't have tolls on their roads,
    and instead make everyone who wants to use their highways at any
    point during the year buy a pass at the beginning of the year, and
    if you don't have one, you can't use the Autobahn at all. This made
    traveling toward the Zurich airport rather more challenging than it
    otherwise should have been. We also had to contend with the fact
    that the Swiss (being weird) are not a part of the EU, and therefore
    our phones did not have service, and so we had to hope we didn't get
    lost, because google maps couldn't save us this time.
  </p>

  <p>
    We drove through some lovely countryside, and it looked pretty much
    like Germany, except for the Swiss flags sprinkled around. The
    accents (Schwyzerdütsch) on the radio were also tricky to
    understand, I realllly had to concentrate to grasp their simple tips
    on how to make a good salad, which I would have been able to catch
    while half listening, were it in Berlin German (Hoch Deutsch, if you
    will.)
  </p>

  <p>
    We eventually arrived in Winterthur, which is a smaller town north
    of the Zurich airport (which is north of the city, which is why we
    decided not to go into the actual city itself.) We had a nice time
    wandering around the cute little town, and after we started to get
    hungry, we found out way into "Co-Op City" which is apparently not
    an actual cooperative, to my great disappointment…We did buy some
    delicious and apparently very typical Swiss butter cookies,
    chocolate-chip pastries, as well as some bread and cheese, however,
    so I guess it wasn't all bad. Ironically, the cheese is not actually
    what we think of as "swiss cheese" at all! After a bit more
    strolling about, and eating of our cheese in the park next to where
    we ended up parking the car, it was already time to set off for the
    airport.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finding the airport was quite an adventure, because of the
    aforementioned navigational challenges, and also because we left
    half an hour later than planned and were therefore kinda stressed.
    Also the pitiful lack of signage was alway leading us toward the
    autobahn, which we couldn't even drive on! We eventually got me to
    the airport, where I said a sad (but fast!) goodbye to Ellen, then
    rushed through security, just in time to wait at the gate for the
    delayed flight--classic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before I knew it, I was back at good ol' Tegel Flughafen, and soon
    enough, I was back at home with Ayse. After dumping my stuff at
    home, we walked down the street to the pizza place at the end of the
    street, that I had walked past every morning and night for 2 months,
    but never been to. We each had a glass of wine and shared a
    delicious tomato, pesto buffalo mozzarella pizza, while we each
    chatted about our weeks. Back at home we had our very last tea chat.
    Although it was bittersweet, as lasts often are, it was also as rich
    as all of our other conversations had been.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before saying goodnight, and finishing my packing, I gave her her
    parting gift: all that yarn I had gotten. It was such a perfect
    demonstration of why they say giving is better than receiving: it
    really was delightful to watch her overwhelmed happy reaction, and
    to see her eyes light up as she planned all her future hats. She was
    at first ashamed that she didn't have anything for me, but I think I
    eventually convinced her that 2 months of delicious food and
    wonderful conversations waaay more than made up for a couple of
    skeins of nice yarn and some needles.
  </p>

  <p>
    I then continued to pack well into the night (rationalizing the
    lateness by telling myself that I was already setting myself up for
    US time…I am pretty proud of being able to get everything in my
    suitcase and somehow only being one kilo over the regulation 23,
    despite Ayse having no scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wrote Ayse a letter thanking her once again for being the best
    host I could have dreamed of, and left it on her little table before
    giving her once last hug, and heading back to Tegel with allll my
    stuff, for the 6th and final time of the summer. I had a pleasantly
    uneventful flight back to Chicago, with an extra seat next to me,
    which in addition to my exhaustion from my 3.5 hours of sleep from
    the night before meant I slept most of the 9 hours.
  </p>

  <p>
    I can't believe it has already been more than a month since that
    journey! I am now into my senior year of college (which I also can't
    believe) and although I do miss Ayse (when this happens I eat one of
    the turkish olives she sent with me) and the other fabulous people I
    met, I am glad to be back, and glad to have had such an amazing
    experience right before my last year of undergrad. I am about to
    have to make so many decisions for my future, and this was certainly
    a valuable experience that I will consider when thinking about where
    to go after this year.
