    Ok everyone, buckle up--this is gonna be a long one, since it was a
    busy week (hence also why it is a week late--I was too tired from all
    this to write about it at the end of the week!)
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Monday</strong> (7/3): It was already time to buy a new
    Monatskarte for the public transportation, because mine was about to
    expire, so I did that after class. I showed up to work in the middle
    of a very technical workshop on civil law and immigrant rights law…I
    consoled myself by admitting that even if I had come at the beginning,
    and it had been in English, I still might not have understood much!
  </p>

  <p>
    After work, I took advantage of the last day on my 3 day museum
    pass to go to the Jewish Museum, which Irving had already seen. I
    found my way over and spent a good 3 hours exploring the huge,
    interesting and well-structured museum. The architecture was very
    interesting and symbolic--the bottom floor made up of different
    axises (the holocaust, exile, perseverance) I really appreciated
    how the museum was not just about the holocaust however, it
    detailed the whole history of the Jews in Germany, from the
    earliest middle ages to the present. There was of course also a
    big focus on the holocaust, as well however, as it should be. I
    was especially moved by an exhibit that was a huge otherwise empty
    room with 10,000+ metal cutouts of faces that represent all
    victims of war apparently (I have a picture of the sign talking
    about it in the google photos) The especially powerful thing about
    the exhibit though, was that you could walk through the room on
    top of all the faces, which made loud clanging noises in the huge
    empty room.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also spent a lot of time looking at a special exhibit that they
    had on religious head coverings. It was super interesting to see
    some art, displays and political and religious opinion pieces from
    a range of perspectives. There were displays and information about
    christian, jewish and islamic head covering traditions and current
    practices, and I actually learned a lot about the topic, from how
    to tie a headscarf in the "arabic" style with chiffon, as well as
    about some of the nuances of the tradition around wig-wearing for
    the women in some more conservative jewish communities. They had a
    map that showed the legal status of head covering in official
    settings (government jobs, schools etc) and it was interesting to
    see where they are banned, and where they are required around the
    world.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Tuesday</strong> was another busy day. While most of you
    were engaged in Independence day festivities, I got up as I have
    every other Tuesday, except that I went to work right away in the
    morning, without going to class. The team from work that developed
    the document that was officially going to be publicized at the big
    conference the following Tuesday was offering a sort of "sneak
    preview" training on it to a partner organization of school
    psychologists, counselors and special education teachers. It was a
    good test run for us, in some ways, but the group was much
    different, and also much smaller, so it was different in some big
    ways too. Andrés (the big boss, if you will) and a partner from
    another organization who had worked with the RAA team to develop
    the principles gave a presentation on them, and then there were
    workshops on some of the principles in the afternoon as well.
    Seeing that group (the counselors etc) made me realize again how
    diverse RAA actually is--they really walk the walk as well as talk
    the talk--I was one of 3 white people on 'the team' which is
    pretty unusual for Germany, and compared to a grand total of no
    people of color from the other organization, it was a big
    contrast.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the training finished up, I went to a market that Ayse had
    been telling me about for weeks that happened to be right in the
    area. It is always interesting to explore the stands and hear the
    chants that roll off the tongues of vendors in markets in all the
    counties I have been to: somehow making "raspberries, 1 Euro for 1
    basket' sound like a song. I got a waiters wallet for my dear
    mother and her many cards at a leather stand, then took advantage
    of that (red) raspberry deal, and then went on to buy some nice
    (white) sunflower seeds. I had to go down the street to Aldi to
    get (blue)berries to complete my one act of patriotism for the
    day, but it worked out ok, since I also was able to put more money
    on my SIM card there.
  </p>

  <p>
    I spent a lovely evening chatting with Ayse as I munched on my red
    white and blue snacks and she started knitting her next hat. After
    chatting, knitting and snacking away for a couple hours, we
    decided to go to bed when we realized that somehow our
    calculations where…QUITE off, and her hat was approximately 60
    stitches too big (more of a child's sweater sized than a hat…)
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Wednesday</strong> was a pretty standard day--work was
    starting to get pretty busy with the big conference coming up the
    next week. I repeated my trend of coming home and taking a 20
    minute nap before dinner--pretty nice luxury. Ayse and I decided
    we had to soak up as much of the rare evening sun as possible, so
    we went over to the Turkish cafe at the end of the street, where
    we drank tea and munched on Turkish delight and pistachios as we
    chased the sun down the street (moving to a total of three
    different tables as it set, and cast more and more of the seating
    into the shadows)
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Thursday</strong> I ate spinach quiche and a muffin for
    lunch at the "Bio Company" down the street from the school, since
    I was too lazy to pack a sandwich. A bit pricy for what I got, but
    a nice change of pace. Work was interesting, since I got to sit in
    on a presentation to some students doing a masters program in
    Child Law, about some of the other projects that RAA does. I heard
    about JUMA (Young, Muslim, Active) and what they actually do,
    working in the other half of the office! It is a group with over
    500 members of all sects and backgrounds that work to empower
    Islamic youth around the city, and to foster discussion <em>with</em> Muslims,
    rather than just <em>about</em> them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The majority of the presentation was focused on the Roma School
    Mediation Project, which (as the name suggests) focuses on
    mediation and integration of Roma youth in the school system. This
    means facilitating communication between parents, teachers,
    students, the school, and the government ministry of education,
    when needed. They are pretty intensively involved in the
    classroom, as well as doing home visits to help do any translation
    or whatever is needed to ensure that every child has the right to
    an education. Another unique feature of the project is that the
    majority (if not all) of the mediators are themselves Roma,
    allowing them to really understand the culture as well as the
    language of the "target population" that they are working with.
    Some also studied education, but RAA also takes personal
    experience seriously, so a degree is not a requirement to do the
    job.
  </p>

  <p>
    I learned a lot about the history of the Roma as well: the early
    origins are a bit unclear, but it is believed by some that they
    came from the Kashmir region of India, and then dispersed
    throughout the world over time. The "Travelers" in the UK, who
    have maintained a nomadic lifestyle are also part of the Roma
    group, as are the Sinti--another subgroup that has been settled in
    Germany for a longer time. They are now an officially recognized
    ethnic group, with a day of recognition and celebration on April
    8.
  </p>

  <p>
    When one of the students asked why being called "Zigeuner"
    ("gypsy" in English) is so insulting, and one of the mediators
    answered immediately: "Do you know who called us that? Hitler." If
    that were not already reason enough, the term is thought to have
    its root in a Greek word that essentially means "poor / dirty /
    untouchable" so it is really no wonder that they prefer to be
    called Roma! We can see a parallel to this in English when we
    think about the term "gypped" to mean cheated--arising from the
    prejudiced assumption that Roma are dishonest thieves.
  </p>

  <p>
    After work I went and bought some rain boots, in the hope that
    that would make it stop raining, and failing that, that I would at
    least have dry feet when it continued to rain (and rain and rain
    and then be cloudy and maybe rain some more…for DAYS). Maybe it
    has finally started to work--we have a couple sunny days predicted
    this week (2 weeks later…)
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Friday</strong> I rushed straight to work after class
    (wolfing down a sandwich on the train) so that I could help stuff
    folders (with note pads, programs, maps and the document with the
    principles and a pencil all in a bag that then went in a boxes) It
    was actually a pretty fun day-chatting with Irène (my boss, whose
    husband happens to be from Appleton Wisconsin!) and Dario (who
    works in reception, but I recently found out used to work in the
    Roma school mediation project). We each ended up developing our
    own assembly line system, and then we had a little down time while
    Sabine (the other receptionist) fought with the printer,
    attempting to get the 200+ name tags to print correctly. We ended
    up being there till 6:30, agonizing over the impossibility of
    packing the awkwardly shaped plastic name tag holders in
    alphabetical order into boxes…suffice it to say we were all a bit
    slap happy at the end of the ordeal!
  </p>

  <p>
    After coming home to relax for a bit, I rallied again and went to
    Willmersdorf to a small climbing gym there. It was a pretty quiet
    evening, so the guy who was working kept checking in on me, and
    giving me tips on certain routes (annoyingly, he was often able to
    do the difficult move better than me even though he was wearing
    old house slippers!) My hands eventually started a mutiny on me,
    and I was forced to call it a night and take my many blisters
    home.
  </p>

  <p>
    I spent <strong>Saturday</strong> with Oliver (Irving was sick)
    and we decided to go to Potsdam to go to a high ropes course that
    our German teacher had told us about. We had to buy an extension
    for our public transport ticket, since Potsdam is in zone C, but
    it was well worth it to explore a new city/part of the city
    (depending on who you ask). We had a lot of fun doing all the
    obstacle courses and zip-lining around a bit--it turns out in some
    ways it is a lot harder than rock climbing, since at least you can
    count on the gym wall to stay still there, but a wiggly rope
    ladder makes you fight with it a bit more before you can get to
    the top.
  </p>

  <p>
    We then strolled around the city a bit, until we heard some music
    and found ourselves at a small fest (this keeps happening-I love
    it!) with food stands, a band and some games. We got some actually
    really delicious food there, and took shelter as it briefly poured
    rain, before continuing our adventure. We ended up stumbling on a
    palace (things that only happen in Germany…or maybe some other
    parts of the world, but I have only had this experience here) We
    strolled through the magnificent gardens for a long time (they are
    quite extensive) and imagined what it would be like to live in
    such a place. We eventually found our way back into the real
    world, where we walked through the city a bit more, until we ran
    across a dance troupe that was performing--so we watched them a
    bit, before heading back to the first fest, where we listened to a
    band from Munich for a bit, then started the trek home.
  </p>

  <p>
    I ended up sleeping in till 11 on <strong>Sunday</strong>, then
    woke up to have breakfast with Ayse, before going to visit Irving
    in Buch (he was feeling a bit better). We just chilled and chatted
    about Earlham and how we ended up there, before deciding that we
    probably needed some ice cream. We had barely left his apartment
    when we met a very lost and frustrated Brazilian man who had
    apparently been bullied by the bus driver, and was thrilled to
    find people who spoke English. He was so happy that we showed him
    where the train station was, that he told us all about his life,
    his church, and the time he met Harrison Ford on the street in New
    York… he was so happy in fact that he insisted on buying our ice
    cream, and really wanted to buy us beer as well, but we declined,
    and headed home instead…
  </p>

  <p>
    I talked on the phone for a while while making dinner, then Ayse
    brought home the most delicious baklava that has ever been made.
    I'm serious. It was probably so divine because of the ridiculous
    quantity of butter literally dripping off of it, but it was soooo
    worth it! I ended up heading to bed pretty early that night, to
    prepare for another big week!
