  <h1>The Long Awaited Conference Week</h1>
  <time datetime="2017-07-31">July 31, 2017</time>

  <p>
    First, I must apologize for the extreme delay for this post…I hope
    you can forgive me when you read about how busy this week (and the
    ones after it) have been.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Monday</strong> (7/10) was fairly uneventful. I ate the
    leftover baklava from the night before (just as heavenly as ever)
    for lunch, then went to work, where I met with Irène and Kofi (a
    colleague who mostly works with the JUMA project) as they had
    their last planing meeting before their workshop for the big
    conference the next day. I then came home and talked to Ayse about
    everything from abortion to beggars to the story of her name,
    until after midnight.
  </p>

  <p>
    The only problem with this wonderful long conversation was, when
    my alarm went off at 5:30 AM on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, I was
    still pretty tired! I managed to make it to the Kalkscheune
    conference center at 7 am as planned, however, where I helped set
    up the workshop rooms, the registration station, and some bulletin
    boards for an all-group activity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Registration didn't actually start till 9, but those punctual
    Germans started showing up closer to 8:30. I was in charge of the
    speakers, workshop leaders and organizers check-in, so that I
    could hand out extra workshop material as needed. It was nice to
    finally see the faces that belonged to the names I had seen in the
    program for weeks! I guess it means that the Germans are not
    actually so punctual, since people were still showing up half an
    hour late, which meant I missed the first couple welcome speeches.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was lucky enough to be able to hand over my registration duty in
    time to hear the author Sharon Dodua Otoo (and because I think it
    is really cool that she has her own wikipedia page, where you can
    read more about her background without me writing it all out, here
    it is: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Dodua_Otoo">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Dodua_Otoo</a>)
  </p>

  <p>
    She was a project leader with RAA until recently, but has now made
    a move to focus on her writing. She told a wonderful allegorical
    story about race, but told through shapes, entitled "Die
    Geschichte von Kreis und Viereck" (The Story of the Circle and
    Square") about a circle in a society of squares, who was
    unappreciated, and criticized, and the struggle of fighting for a
    place, and for recognition in a society that could only see shapes
    in comparison to the straightness and 90 degree virtues of the
    square mindset. It was both funny and powerful, and I am about to
    buy her books.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, Miriam Camara and Andrés Nadar (the RAA director) did a
    general intro to the principles (pretty similar to last wenek's
    training). After that, the group transitioned to an activity
    thought-up and introduced by the moderator (who works a desk away
    from me) Yaari Pannwitz. This is where we needed all the bulletin
    boards: in "the loft" upstairs, the attendees were invited to
    write comments, questions and thoughts on a piece of Flipchart
    paper pinned up next to each principle. People wrote and wrote and
    wrote! It was really interesting to see the different
    difficulties, that people had with the ideas, but also what they
    especially appreciated. Yaari and I ended up having to run around
    and get more paper because there was not room for all the thoughts
    on one sheet.
  </p>

  <p>
    From there we went downstairs to a delicious lunch, where I met
    some other RAA colleagues from other projects that I had not
    visited yet. After lunch, and a short intro to each of the seven
    workshop leaders, we broke up into workshop groups. I went with
    Iène, Kofi and Sonja Dudek (from another organization) to their
    workshop about project development, and diversity as a benchmark.
    It was interesting to see the planning meetings manifest
    themselves in reality, and to hear the feedback of the other
    members of the group. It got a little tricky when we broke up into
    smaller groups to talk about examples from our own projects, and I
    didn't have any…but it worked out alright in that I could just
    listen.
  </p>

  <p>
    To wrap up the official part of the day, there was a panel
    discussion on impressions and takeaways. It was interesting to
    hear over and over things along the lines of "I felt so
    comfortable in this group, as a <tt>______</tt> (person of color, person
    with a disability, etc)" and it did really make me reflect on how
    (as a white person) feeling comfortable in a group is the norm for
    me. It just goes to show how important events, organizations and
    projects like this are: everyone deserves to feel comfortable, and
    for me it was also good to realize my privilege.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the panel wrapped up (half an hour late…) I was assured over
    and over by Irène that I did not actually need to help clean up (I
    guess it is the camp counselor in me that always wants to be ready
    for the next activity…) but eventually I conquered this urge, and
    went upstairs to the "break room" where I chatted and laughed with
    all the tired, relieved speakers, whose work was finally done.
    There was a generally jolly "we did it!" atmosphere, which made
    the already wonderful people even more fun to hangout with.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventually, after some shoe changing, and even a few showers, we
    trickled back downstairs for the private (organization and special
    guests only) after party / one-year-late-25th-birthday-party for
    RAA Berlin, which was founded in '91 (they were too busy or else
    just forgot to celebrate last year, so this seemed like a good
    time to party, since everyone was already there for the
    conference). The food was once again very good, and I had a really
    fun time chatting with some other new people, as we were all
    crammed onto a thin bench, eating. There was a minimal amount of
    formal speaking, and the bouquet that was given to Andrés and the
    first Director were really the only formal parts of the evening.
    Then the party continued.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next came the dancing. To be honest, when the party plan was first
    described to me, I was pretty skeptical about how this portion
    could possibly be NOT awkward--dancing with my co-workers, all of
    whom are at least 10, if not closer to 30 years older than me,
    some of whom I barely know… As many of you know, I love to dance,
    but I was just not sure about the social situation. I shouldn't
    have worried. As soon as I saw the already full dance floor, I
    knew I wouldn't stop dancing till the music stopped, and that it
    would be a wonderful night. The mood was so relaxed, friendly and
    goofy that it really felt more like a family wedding--my favorite
    place to dance--than a work party. The DJ was also super
    good--reading the crowd well, and he played everything from
    Buenavista Social Club, to Michael Jackson. Shoes were kicked to
    the side, and flower vases were commandeered as "microphones"
    (Sharon, who only spilled a little bit of the water on Miriam…)
    and everyone sang along and boogied however it felt right--with no
    pressure to look cool or impress anyone. We were all just happy to
    be done with the conference, and to be together dancing.
  </p>

  <p>
    We eventually had to go home around 11 (I suppose 16 hours without
    leaving the building was enough…but now that I think about it, but
    it actually didn't seem that long) I ended up riding home on the
    U-Bahn with Daniel Hornber (one of the panelists) and Sabrine(a?)
    who works on one of the projects I was going to see the next week
    (and who happened to also go to a Waldorf school). I was starting
    to feel preeeety tired by the time I got home however, and suffice
    it to say I barely managed to take a quick shower to wash off all
    the dance-sweat before collapsing into bed.
  </p>

  <p>
    On <strong>Wednesday</strong> things pretty much went back to
    normal. I ended up eating a lot of soup (a side-effect of the
    seemingly perpetual rainy weather…) since I didn't wanna pack a
    lunch. I ate at a German restaurant down the street for lunch. At
    work I helped Irène disassemble all the leftover bags we had put
    together last week. For dinner Ayse and I went to the other
    Tibetan restaurant in the neighborhood and had some more soup. I
    thought it was pretty yummy (and I forgave the long wait, but
    apparently the whole thing was just not up to her standards)
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Thursday's</strong> class was funny, since we did a "pass
    it along" story rotation, where each group is given a beginning to
    a fairy tale, but things started to get goofy as each group wrote
    a little farther then passed it along. The best story (in my
    humble opinion) involved a lesbian princess who ended up running
    away with a witch to Turkey, after deciding that she didn't need
    to kill her parents after all, so therefore the pact with the
    witch (involving pig blood, eyes and bratwurst…) ended up turning
    into a wedding and a honeymoon in Turkey…why not?
  </p>

  <p>
    After class and work, I finally made it to the Naturkundemuseum
    (Museum of Natural History) that is at the subway stop between
    school and work, but that I had never found time to go to somehow,
    despite passing it twice every day on my way to work…I saw lots of
    dinosaur bones, fish fossils and cool minerals (as well as a
    detailed exhibit on taxidermy!) before getting kicked out sehr
    punktlich at 18:00 Uhr, when the museum closed.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had a nice watermelon-cheese-pepper-bread dinner with Ayse,
    followed by some tea and some knitting (on her part) and yet
    another lovely talk, this time about love and relationships.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Friday</strong> I did not have to go into work, since
    there was not going to be anyone there anyway, so I was finally
    able to meet some people from class to go get lunch. It was nice
    to speak some "Deutschañol" at the very hip restaurant we found
    ourselves in. Since the majority were Spanish speaking (1
    Colombian, 1 Spaniard, 2 Argentinians) and then me and the German
    teacher, it was certainly an interesting mix of languages.
  </p>

  <p>
    I then wandered home to watch 3 hours of Spanish TV while I ate a
    delicious fresh salad. It was a welcome lazy afternoon to finish
    off a busy work week. Ayse came home bearing a delicious apple
    cookie, which led to some more dinner and more chatting about work
    and life. It ended up being a rather early night to bed.
  </p>

  <p>
    On <strong>Saturday</strong>, Irving and I had planned to meet his
    Abendkurs classmates from the language school at the Spektrum
    Museum at 11. We managed 12, but we ended up finding them anyway.
    We strolled through the various floors full of interactive science
    exhibits on sound, optics and motion for a while, then (since
    entry way free that day) we hopped on over to the Deutsches
    Technisches Museum, just to check it out. We had only seen one
    room full of old cars, and one of old computers when we both kind
    of realized we didn't actually care too much about old cars or
    computers in general, and especially on a rare beautiful sunny
    Saturday. So we left.
  </p>

  <p>
    We decided we were hungry, and ready for some lunch. So we
    U-Bahned our way to "Thai Park" (recognized as such even by google
    maps.) It is kind of what you might expect: a park full of Thai
    (and other south east Asian) food vendors. We strolled around the
    stands, and I eventually opted for some Korean vegetable pancakes,
    which were soooo yummy, and Irving went for some red curry. We had
    to quickly find Irving some water however, since the curry was
    painfully spicy, even for someone who grew up eating chilies! I
    also grabbed myself a mango lassie before we headed out.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our next stop was Nollendorfplatz, where we followed the
    colorfully clad public toward the Lesbian-Gay City Festival.
    Probably partly because of the good weather, it was SO full, so
    full that it made it a little hard to enjoy the festivities,
    because you were being pushed and herded along the entire time.
    Around the same time, Irving and I also both came to the
    conclusion that it was pretty much just like any other German
    street festival we had been to: you had your cocktail vendors, the
    food stands, the cloths stands and the music. The main difference,
    aside from a few LGBTQ+ organizations that were represented, was
    that everything was rainbow, and there were more gay men in
    underwear…
  </p>

  <p>
    It was interesting to note how the Israel-Palestine debate got so
    mixed up in the whole event as well, however. There were many
    people handing out rainbow Israeli flags, but we also saw a fair
    bit of graffiti with the stencil "No pride in Israeli Apartheid."
    It was an interesting example of some of the issues that get
    talked about a lot at Earlham. After walking from end to end of
    the fest, we felt like we had seen enough, and ended up leaving
    and finding a little park to relax in for a bit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Irving then voiced his Starbucks craving, so we looked up the
    nearest franchise, and found ourself sitting in the very
    American/tourist-filled shop when it poured rain, so that was
    lucky. I wondered aloud who would want to buy an over-priced
    ceramic mug that said "Germany" (rather than "Deutschland" at
    least…) from Starbucks as a souvenir of Berlin, when along came a
    guy who did…
  </p>

  <p>
    We then parted ways, and I wandered home where I made a delicious
    veggie-filled dinner, before doing some video chatting.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Sunday</strong> morning was a bit lazy--as Sunday mornings
    are allowed to be, in my opinion. I did manage to get some laundry
    done, and have a nice late breakfast with Ayse, before chatting
    with the family for a bit. I then rallied myself and left the
    house to go to one of the last climbing gyms on my list. I stopped
    at the Brandenburger Tor on the way, because I wanted to check off
    this touristy destination before my time in Berlin ran out. The
    whole detour took maybe 5 minutes.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I got to the climbing gym, the guy at the check-in desk
    warned me that they had a "very small boulder room"--ha! If that
    was very small, he should come to Earlham and see our wall, which
    to him would probably be microscopic (it is maybe a fourth of the
    size of that room…) I had a fun time trying out some routes,
    before heading outside to do some slacklining in the back.
  </p>

  <p>
    I then headed back home, where I thankfully ate the rice, lentil
    and yogurt dish Ayse had made, as we chatted about our days'. I
    was tired enough after my climbing adventure, that I was able to
    return to my bed I had left not that long ago, and make an early
    night of it.
  </p>
