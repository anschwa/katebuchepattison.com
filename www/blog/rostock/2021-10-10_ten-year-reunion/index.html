  <p>
    This is a link to the photos, though there aren't nearly as many this time:

      We boarded a train in Zell am See that would retrace our
      southbound steps partway back north. From Zell to Wörgel, then
      back to Munich, and from there we diverged from our former path
      and went to Stuttgart, then on to Pforzheim. There we would meet
      up with Louisa, my exchange sister who first introduced me to
      Germany <em>ten years ago</em>. Though in many ways it feels
      like just last week.
    </p>

    <p>
      The train ride had been largely uneventful, except for some
      worries that Adam wouldn't be able to stagger his way to our
      connecting trains very easily, because of his still-sore knee.
      We made all the connections with no issues, but unfortunately
      realized Adam had forgotten his trusty rusty (colored) raincoat
      on out last train, which had already pulled out of the station
      when I ran back (on my still sore-muscled legs, I'll add) to
      check. A raincoat is a rough thing to loose when you live
      somewhere as damp as Germany!
    </p>

    <p>
      It really did feel like almost no time had passed when I gave
      Louisa a giant hug at the Pforzheim Hauptbahnhof&mdash;the place we
      traveled through every day on our way to our tenth grade
      glasses, all those years ago. It was a bit odd for me, that Adam
      and Louisa&mdash;two people I know so well, had never met each other.
      Once they had we fell into conversation as always&mdash;switching
      from English to German as vocabulary was forgotten and
      remembered. We grabbed a quick dinner at McDonald's (it was on
      the way…) and stopped at the grocery store for some provisions
      before heading back to her adorable apartment in a village near
      Karlsruhe.
    </p>

    <p>
      That evening we pretty much just hung out on her balcony, eating
      some very early Christmas treats of Lebkuchen, and catching up.
      Amidst life updates we also caught sight of the most gigantic
      and slow-moving shooting star that any of us had ever seen. It
      really was stunning: arcing across at least a quarter of the sky
      in blazing magnificence. We were a little worried for the
      French, since it seemed to be arcing toward France, and we
      figured anything making that much light must have been huge&mdash;but
      apparently whatever it was burned out before causing any major
      extinctions, since we didn't hear anything on the news about it
      the next day. It was quite remarkable to witness. Louisa, ever
      the gracious host, gave up her cozy bed to Adam and I, so she
      could sleep on the couch and sneak off to work early the next
      morning.
    </p>

    <p>
      After so much walking the past few days in Austria, we really
      pendulum-swung in the other direction on Friday, and didn't
      leave the house the entire day. Louisa was home early so we
      played some Mario-Kart (I don't think I'll ever be good at a
      video game. Ever. I could barely stay on the track, and was last
      every time…) Eventually Louisa and I left Adam to improve his
      technique and earn her some new high scores&mdash;or unlock
      new…things? Levels? Like I said, I don't know things about
      video games since I rarely play them and hence am terrible at
      them. Anyway, we went to sit on her lovely balcony in the
      daylight this time, and chat some more, in German.
    </p>

    <p>
      We made pizza that evening, and broke out the photo book I had
      made for Louisa when she left little old Westby Wisconsin to go
      back to her real home and family in the winter of 2012. Although
      it really felt like she had become part of my family, a real
      sister, in the 6 months she lived with us, because she did
      everything with me. We laughed at how much Liam still looked
      like my <em>little</em> brother back then, unlike the bearded
      giant he is ten years later. We cackled at the <q>fashion</q> tastes
      of our 15 year old selves, and our goofy Halloween costumes (she
      was a postereboard note-book, and I was a pencil on stilts!) We
      also realized that I had the sweater I was wearing in several of
      the pictures sitting on the back of my chair in the present
      moment&mdash;not sure what that says about my fashion sense as a 25
      year old…But I think I get points for following the maxim <q>use
      it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without!</q> to the letter.
      Such a lovely trip down memory lane!
    </p>

      <figcaption>Yikes…we thought we were so cute and clever…</figcaption>

    <p>
      After dinner, we played some more games&mdash;including a fun card
      game she had that was all about bean farming and trading&mdash;pretty
      hard to describe, but quite fun, once you learn the rules. It
      also had lots of cute cartoon beans on the cards, and some good
      legume vocabulary for me. We also played a dice game I remember
      fondly from my time living with her family: Mäxle. It's a simple
      game in theory&mdash; played with 2 dice, a cup and a coaster. The
      higher of the two numbers you roll becomes the tens place, the
      lower the ones place. So if you roll a 4 and a 5, it is 54,
      never 45. The highest you can roll is 65, unless you get
      doubles, which go up in normal ascending order, so that double
      4s are higher than double 1s. The highest of all is Mäxle
      though, which is a 1 and a 2, and if you roll that everyone else
      gets a point. You are out when you reach the agreed upon point
      limit of the game.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game is almost equal parts luck and bluffing, since the
      first person who rolls peeks under the cup and reports their
      roll, then the next person has to get higher than that, or else
      lie and say they did. If the person after them doesn't believe
      the report, they ask to see and if it WAS a lie, the liar gets a
      point and has to roll again, if it was true, the doubter gets a
      point and play moves to them. It's a fun game to play with a new
      or mixed group, but also with people you've know a long time, to
      see everyone's bluffing abilities. It was always very
      challenging for me to play in German since the way they say
      their numbers is <q>three and twenty</q> instead of the easier to
      remember left to right way! Also I am a pretty bad liar… But
      we had a lovely game night before heading to bed early-ish so we
      could get up and drive to Pforzheim for breakfast with Louisa's
      parents the next morning.
    </p>

    <p>
      We stopped at Edeka again on our way to town to pick up the
      all-important Brötchen (rolls) for the feast, and arrived to a
      lovely sunny morning meal with Christine and Jean-Yves. Once
      again, despite all the years, and the different house and dog,
      and the absence of Louisa's sister Marie and the addition of
      Adam…in a lot of ways it was like I had never left. We fell
      right back into our breakfast spread of nutella, honey, various
      cheeses, meats, olives, fruit and vegetables just like the old
      days. Luckily Adam had something to do as he munched through his
      food while I was too busy chattering away in German to even eat
      the yumminess in front of me for the first 20 minutes or so.

      After cleaning up, we got a quick tour of the in-progress
      kitchen renovations, and then set off into town towards an art
      exhibit at the Gasometer in Pforzheim. The artist Yadegar Asisi,
      known for his large-scale panoramas, put together a life-sized
      depiction of a section of the Great Barrier Reef, from below sea
      level. The experience is a bit hard to describe, since it really
      was quite overwhelming. After some introductory info on the reef
      ecosystem, you walk into the room that used to store the gas to
      power all the streetlights in Pforzheim, which is several
      stories tall. You see images of fish, divers, sharks, turtles,
      coral and way up at the ceiling, the surface of the ocean. The
      images cover the round walls from floor to ceiling, and the
      lights dim and brighten periodically showing the reef during
      both day and night. There is a central tower of stairs in the
      middle of the room so you could see the scene from different
      depths, as it were. We marveled at the details from multiple
      angles&mdash;overwhelmed at the sheer scope of the piece.

        This was from the ground, looking all the way up. It doesn't
        nearly do it justice, as you can imagine.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      After exploring all the levels, we headed back out into the
      bright morning sunshine, where Adam and Jean-Yves faced off at a
      1 v 1 sitting soccer game. America beat France, Jean-Yves told
      me, blaming bad knees as the weak point, even though Adam's
      knees were still mending as well. We also got some free wooden
      spoons, pasta and gummy bears from the public state-run health
      insurance agency who had set up camp outside the museum, and was
      trying to improve their public image. None of us changed our
      insurance provider, but we did get some free stuff! Eventually
      Louisa drove us back to the house where we finished the tour of
      the back garden&mdash;complete with fig tree, berry patch and an
      expanded workshop for Jean-Yves.
    </p>

    <p>
      We settled in the dappled sunlight filtering through the grape
      arbor onto the outdoor table, where we set up another round of
      Mäxle. It was an interesting linguistic mix, as Jean-Yves's
      English isn't as polished, given that German is already a second
      language learned after his native French, so when it was his
      turn the game was in German, but it had to transition to English
      by Adam's turn. Naturally I sat between them and had to do all
      the linguistic gymnastics of bluffing in 2 languages! It's
      always fun though, and it was extra nice to see Christine's
      sister, Louisa's aunt Barbara who came over from across town to
      play as well. A bottle of wine, several hours and many pretzels
      later, after Adam had complemented the beer they had recently
      gotten from the Black Forest, we somehow left with more goodies
      than we had arrived with, as Jean-Yves gifted us with a
      champagne-style bottle of <q>the only good beer from France</q> and a
      six-pack of the Black Forest beer! Louisa had stuck with water
      and cola, so she could safely drive us to pick up her boyfriend
      Manuel (Manu) on our way to dinner in Pforzheim.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ironically, the burger place actually had more vegetarian
      options for me than the traditional German restaurant did, so
      that's where Louisa had made a reservation for us. The food was
      indeed good, and the cocktails were tasty too. We ended up
      over-estimating our fry consumption abilities, and took a
      container of sweet potato fries and a container of regular fries
      to add to the beer already in the trunk.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not quite ready to call it quits, we found ourselves at an oddly
      beach-themed bar, where we split some chocolatey pastries for
      dessert and played even more Mäxle&mdash;we were really getting into
      it. Sitting next to Manu was a mistake for me since every time I
      doubted that he had rolled yet another double, and made him
      prove it, he really had! So I definitely lost, but had a great
      time nonetheless. We headed to drop off Manu and get some sleep
      before it got too late, because Adam and I had an early train
      the next morning.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I woke up earlier than I would have liked on Sunday
      morning, Louisa had already packed a giant bag of food for us.
      It was filled with Lebkuchen, Leibnitz sandwich cookies (which
      we have since fallen completely in love with) actual sandwiches
      we had made the night before, the leftover fries and of course
      all that beer from Jean-Yves. Good thing we had packed light up
      to that point! Louisa dropped us off at the Karlsruhe
      Hauptbahnhof before the sun could warm the day up at all, so we
      said some quick <q>Aufwiedersehen</q>s (literally <q>on seeing you
      again</q> which is much nicer than goodbye, isn't it? Nicely
      open-ended) and headed to board our train.
    </p>

    <p>
      It turned out to have been a good thing that we reserved seats,
      as the train was quite full. It made for relaxing sleeping, as
      there was only one other woman in our private compartment. It
      <em>Hogwarts Express</em> or the <em>Orient Express</em> I
      was also fun since we could pretend we were on the the
      suppose, but the latter is decidedly more spooky and less
      cheery, so I went for the former. When I wasn't reading another
      book, I found myself speculating at what point the woman sitting
      next to us would reveal herself to actually be Professor Lupin
      in disguise…
    </p>

    <p>
      We made it to Hogwarts&mdash;no wait, Hamburg with no issues (unlike
      when we were going in the other direction!) and then proceeded
      to miss our last train to Rostock in probably the dumbest way I
      have ever missed a train. And as many of you know, I have missed
      a surprising number of trains in my relatively short life. We
      were on the right platform with plenty of time to spare, but
      just too far up, so we didn't see our train coming until it was
      pulling out of the station without us. Luckily, we were able to
      get on the next one without issues, and without a new ticket.
      But it does seem like maybe Hamburg as a city is mad at us for
      not having properly explored it yet (we arrived and left in the
      dark the last time) and never left the station the next time.
      Since I left my sleeping bag at Maggie's, to avoid toting it
      across Europe, we will have to come back soon and rectify the
      situation and make our peace with the apparently spiteful
      Hamburg transit system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, I had the following Monday off, so was able to re-set
      and do some laundry etc before starting back at school again. It
      was a relatively run-of-the-mill week, with the highlights being
      the more mundane joys of everyday life, rather than impressive
      works of art or stunning mountain-scapes of the week before.
      Namely: the gorgeously colorful salad that I carefully arranged,
      then realized the bowl was way to small to toss the dressing in,
      so I had to dump it all into a giant stew pot, out of which I
      ungracefully chomped the entire thing away. There is something
      so satisfying about a gigantic salad, isn't there? We also got
      to eat those free noodles from Pforzheim and use the new spoon
      with some tasty pesto, which was nice.
    </p>

      </a>

      <figcaption>So colorful, so symmetrical&mdash;it couldn't last</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      I guess it was a colorful week. Between lovely red leaves along
      my biking path on the way to work, to the salad, to the lovely
      sunset I glimpsed over the river. A week off had been the
      perfect amount for me, though some of the busier teachers at
      school disagreed. Since my work schedule can hardly be called
      overly demanding (by any stretch of the imagination) and I have
      really been enjoying the work, it was nice to get back to
      routine after a burst of adventure the week before.

          The <a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/">Fulbright</a>
          organization wants me to be explicit about the fact that the views
          and opinions you will read here are my own, and not meant to
          represent Fulbright Germany in any way. Whew, now that the
          official bit is over, let's dig in!
